Send notifications to [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) network rooms.

The requirements for this notification method are:

1.  The url of the homeserver (`https://homeserver:port`).
2.  Credentials for connecting to the homeserver, in the form of a valid access token for your account (or for a
    dedicated notification account). These tokens usually don't expire.
3.  The room ids that you want to sent the notification to.

To obtain the access token, you can use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -XPOST -d '{"type":"m.login.password", "user":"example", "password":"wordpass"}' "https://homeserver:8448/_matrix/client/r0/login"
```

The room ids are unique identifiers and can be obtained from the room settings in a Matrix client (e.g. Riot). Their
format is `!uniqueid:homeserver`.

Multiple room ids can be defined by separating with a space character.

Detailed information about the Matrix client API is available at the [official
site](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/client-server.html).

Your `health_alarm_notify.conf` should look like this:

```conf
###############################################################################
#

SEND_MATRIX="YES"

MATRIX_HOMESERVER="https://matrix.org:8448"

MATRIX_ACCESSTOKEN="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_MATRIX="!XXXXXXXXXXXX:matrix.org"
```
