The [SMS Server Tools 3](http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/) is a SMS Gateway software which can send and receive short messages through GSM modems and mobile phones.

To have Netdata send notifications via SMS Server Tools 3, you'll first need to [install](http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/index.php?p=compiling) and [configure](http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/index.php?p=configure) smsd.

Ensure that the user `netdata` can execute `sendsms`. Any user executing `sendsms` needs to:

-   Have write permissions to `/tmp` and `/var/spool/sms/outgoing`
-   Be a member of group `smsd`

To ensure that the steps above are successful, just `su netdata` and execute `sendsms phone message`.

You then just need to configure the recipient phone numbers in `health_alarm_notify.conf`:

```sh
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEND_SMS="YES"


DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_SMS=""
```

Netdata uses the script `sendsms` that is installed by `smstools3` and just passes a phone number and a message to it. If `sendsms` is not in `$PATH`, you can pass its location in `health_alarm_notify.conf`:

```sh
sendsms=""
```
