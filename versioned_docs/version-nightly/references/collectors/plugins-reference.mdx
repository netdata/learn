Netdata can collect metrics from hundreds of different sources, be they internal data created by the system itself, or
external data created by services or applications. To see _all_ of the sources Netdata collects from, view our
[list of supported collectors](/docs/nightly/references/collectors/supported-collectors-list).

There are two essential points to understand about how collecting metrics works in Netdata:

- All collectors are **installed by default** with every installation of Netdata. You do not need to install
  collectors manually to collect metrics from new sources.
- Upon startup, Netdata will **auto-detect** any application or service that has a
  [collector](/docs/nightly/references/collectors/supported-collectors-list), as long as both the collector
  and the app/service are configured correctly.

Most users will want to enable a new Netdata collector for their app/service. For those details, see
our [collectors' configuration reference](/docs/nightly/setup/collectors-configuration).
