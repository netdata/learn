## The Netdata dashboard

Netdata's dashboard can be broken down into three key areas:

1.  [**Sections**](#sections)
2.  [**Time & date picker**](#time--date-picker)
3.  [**Metrics menus/submenus**](#metrics-menus)
4.  [**Netdata Cloud menus: Spaces, War Rooms, and Visited nodes)**](#cloud-menus-spaces-war-rooms-and-visited-nodes)

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/101509403-f7e59400-3935-11eb-9abd-cbecfa3ee49a.png)

### Sections

Netdata is broken up into multiple **sections**, such as **System Overview**,
**CPU**, **Disk**, and more. Inside each section you'll find a number of charts,
broken down into [contexts](/docs/agent/web#contexts) and
[families](/docs/agent/web#families).

An example of the **Memory** section on a Linux desktop system.

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/101508423-e354cc00-3934-11eb-9b33-3ad57a5988b4.png)

All sections and their associated charts appear on a single page, so all you need to do to view different sections is
scroll up and down. But it's usually quicker to use the [menus](#metrics-menus).

### Time & date picker

The local dashboard features a time & date picker to help you visualize specific timeframes of historical metrics. The
picker chooses an appropriate default to always show per-second granularity based on the width of your browser's
viewport.

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/101507784-2c585080-3934-11eb-9d6e-eff30b8553e4.png)

Use the Quick Selector to show metrics from the last 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours, or 12 hours.

Beneath the Quick Selector is an input field and dropdown you use in combination to select a specific timeframe of
minutes, hours, days, or months. Enter a number and choose the appropriate unit of time.

Use the calendar to select multiple days. Click on a date to begin the timeframe selection, then an ending date. 

Click **Apply** to re-render all visualizations with new metrics data, or **Clear** to restore the default timeframe.

[Increase the metrics retention policy](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage) for your node to see more historical
timeframes.

### Metrics menus

**Metrics menus** appears on the right-hand side of the local Agent dashboard. Netdata generates a menu for each
section, and menus link to the section they're associated with.

![A screenshot of metrics menus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80834638-f08f2880-8ba5-11ea-99ae-f610b2885fd6.png)

Most metrics menu items will contain several **submenu** entries, which represent any
[families](/docs/agent/web#families) from that section. Netdata automatically
generates these submenu entries.

Here's a **Disks** menu with several submenu entries for each disk drive and
partition Netdata recognizes.

submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80834697-11577e00-8ba6-11ea-979c-92fd19cdb480.png)

### Cloud menus (Spaces, War Rooms, and Visited nodes)

The dashboard also features a menu related to Netdata Cloud functionality. You can view your existing Spaces or create
new ones via the left vertical column of boxes. This menu also displays the name of your current Space, shows a list of
any War Rooms you've added you your Space, and lists any notes you recently visited via their Agent dashboards. Click on
a War Room's name to jump to the Netdata Cloud web interface.

![A screenshot of the Cloud
menus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80837210-3f8b8c80-8bab-11ea-9c75-128c2d823ef8.png)

If you want to know more about how Cloud populates this menu, and the Agent-Cloud integration at a high level, see our
document on [using the Agent with Netdata Cloud](/docs/agent/agent-cloud).



## Charts

A **chart** is an individual, interactive, always-updating graphic displaying
one or more collected/calculated metrics. Charts are generated by
[collectors](/docs/agent/collectors). 

Here's the system CPU chart, the first chart displayed on the standard
dashboard:

![Screenshot of the system CPU chart in the Netdata
dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/62720972-0b8a8e80-b9c0-11e9-930b-4829f7b17cfd.png)

Netdata displays a chart's name in parentheses above the chart. For example, if
you navigate to the system CPU chart, you'll see the label: **Total CPU
utilization (system.cpu)**. In this case, the chart's name is `system.cpu`.
Netdata derives the name from the chart's [context](#contexts).

### Descriptions

Many charts come with a short description of what dimensions the chart is displaying and why they matter.

For example, here's the description that accompanies the **Memory Page Faults (mem.pgfaults)** chart.

> A page fault is a type of interrupt, called trap, raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory
> page that is mapped into the virtual address space, but not actually loaded into main memory. If the page is loaded in
> memory at the time the fault is generated, but is not marked in the memory management unit as being loaded in memory,
> then it is called a minor or soft page fault. A major page fault is generated when the system needs to load the memory
> page from disk or swap memory.

If you're new to monitoring and troubleshooting, we recommend you spend some time reading these descriptions to learn
more about why you might care about something strange happening on a given chart and what you should do next.


### Positive and negative values on charts

To improve clarity on charts, Netdata dashboards present **positive** values for metrics representing `read`, `input`,
`inbound`, `received` and **negative** values for metrics representing `write`, `output`, `outbound`, `sent`.

values](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/81870401-9d649080-952a-11ea-80e3-4a7b480252ee.gif)

### Autoscaled y-axis

Netdata charts automatically zoom vertically, to visualize the variation of each metric within the visible timeframe.
