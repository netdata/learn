# Export Metrics to External Time-Series Databases

Netdata natively provides long-term metrics retention through its tiered database design. This architecture delivers significantly longer retention (months to years) and faster queries (typically 20+ times faster) compared to other common time-series databases.

For integration with other observability tools, Netdata includes exporters that copy metrics to third-party time-series databases for additional analysis or integration with other tools.

## Exporting Capabilities

The exporting engine provides these key features:

- **Multi-database support**: Export to [more than thirty](#supported-databases) databases including InfluxDB, Prometheus, Graphite, ElasticSearch, and more
- **Downsampling**: Configure export intervals from Netdata's per-second metrics (e.g., per minute)
- **Simultaneous exports**: Send metrics to multiple time-series databases at once
- **Flexible data processing**: Export metrics as-collected, normalized averages, or sum/volume over configured intervals
- **Selective exporting**: Filter specific charts based on your needs and allocated resources

## Supported Databases

Netdata exports metrics to the following databases through various [connectors](/docs/exporting-metrics/exporting-reference#supported-connectors). Each connector includes documentation with [enabling instructions](/docs/exporting-metrics/enable-an-exporting-connector).
