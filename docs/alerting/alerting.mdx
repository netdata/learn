# Alerts and notifications

The Netdata Agent is a health watchdog for the health and performance of your systems, services, and applications. We've
worked closely with our community of DevOps engineers, SREs, and developers to define hundreds of production-ready
alerts that work without any configuration.

The Agent's health monitoring system is also dynamic and fully customizable. You can write entirely new alerts, tune the
community-configured alerts for every app/service [the Agent collects metrics from](/docs/data-collection/monitor-anything), or
silence anything you're not interested in. You can even power complex lookups by running statistical algorithms against
your metrics.

You can [use various alert notification methods](/docs/alerting/notifications), 
[customize alerts](/docs/alerting/health-configuration-reference), and 
[disable/silence](/docs/alerting/health-configuration-reference#disable-or-silence-alerts) alerts.
