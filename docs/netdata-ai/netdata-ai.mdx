# Netdata AI

Netdata AI transforms infrastructure monitoring from reactive dashboards to intelligent, proactive observability. Our AI-powered features help you troubleshoot faster, predict problems before they occur, and optimize your infrastructure with data-driven insights.

## AI Features Overview

### üîç [AI Insights](./insights/ai-insights)
**Strategic Infrastructure Analysis**

Generate comprehensive reports that transform your metrics into actionable intelligence. Perfect for capacity planning, performance reviews, and executive briefings.

- **Infrastructure Summary** - Complete system health overview and incident analysis
- **Capacity Planning** - Growth projections with resource recommendations
- **Performance Optimization** - Bottleneck identification and tuning suggestions
- **Anomaly Analysis** - Deep dive into unusual patterns and their impacts

**Available**: Netdata Cloud (Business & Free Trial)

---

### üî¨ [AI Investigations](./investigations/custom-investigations)
**Conversational Troubleshooting**

Ask open-ended questions about your infrastructure and receive deeply researched reports in minutes. Your AI Co-SRE analyzes real-time data to provide contextual answers.

- Natural language queries about any infrastructure concern
- Comprehensive analysis with root cause hypothesis
- Perfect for incident response and optimization tasks
- Context-aware responses based on your actual metrics

**Available**: Netdata Cloud (Business & Free Trial)

---

### üö® [AI Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting/ai-powered-alert-troubleshooting)
**Automated Alert Analysis**

When alerts fire, skip the manual investigation. AI automatically analyzes alert history, correlates signals across your infrastructure, and provides root cause analysis.

- Instant alert triage and impact assessment
- Correlated metrics from across your infrastructure
- Root cause hypothesis with supporting evidence
- [Anomaly Advisor](./troubleshooting/anomaly-advisor) for visual correlation

**Available**: Netdata Cloud (Business & Free Trial)

---

### ü§ñ [Anomaly Detection](./anomaly-detection/ml-anomaly-detection)
**Machine Learning-Powered Monitoring**

Automatically detect unusual patterns in your metrics without manual threshold configuration. ML models learn your system's normal behavior and alert on deviations.

- Unsupervised learning adapts to your infrastructure
- [Metric Correlations](./anomaly-detection/metric-correlations) across services
- [Configurable sensitivity](./anomaly-detection/ml-configuration)
- [Accuracy insights](./anomaly-detection/ml-accuracy) for model performance

**Available**: All Netdata deployments

### üí¨ [AI Chat](./chat/chat-with-netdata)
**Natural Language Infrastructure Interaction**

Chat with your infrastructure using natural language through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Ask questions, get instant answers, and explore your systems conversationally.

**Integration Options**:
- [Netdata Web Client](./chat/netdata-web-client) - Purpose-built chat interface
- [Claude Desktop](./chat/claude-desktop) - Anthropic's AI assistant
- [Cursor](./chat/cursor) - AI-powered code editor
- [VS Code](./chat/visual-studio-code) - Popular IDE integration
- [JetBrains IDEs](./chat/jetbrains-ides) - IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.
- [Claude Code](./chat/claude-code) - CLI AI assistant
- [Gemini CLI](./chat/gemini-cli) - Google's command-line AI

**Available**: All Netdata deployments (Agent & Parents)

## Getting Started

### For Netdata Cloud Users
1. Access AI features through the **Insights** tab in your Space
2. Use "Troubleshoot with AI" buttons throughout the interface
3. Business and Free Trial users get full access to all features

### For Netdata Agent Users
1. Set up the [Model Context Protocol](./chat/model-context-protocol-mcp)
2. Choose your preferred [AI Chat client](./chat/chat-with-netdata)
3. Start conversing with your infrastructure in natural language

## Architecture

Netdata AI operates on two levels:

**Cloud-Based AI** (Insights, Investigations, Troubleshooting)
- Processes historical data from your Netdata Cloud Space
- Generates comprehensive reports and analysis
- No data used for model training

**Local AI Integration** (Chat, DevOps Copilot)
- Direct connection to Netdata Agents via MCP
- Real-time data access without cloud dependency
- Complete data privacy and control

## Privacy & Security

- **Your data remains yours** - Never used for AI model training
- **Ephemeral processing** - Data analyzed then immediately discarded
- **Audit trails** - Track all AI operations in your Space
- **Local options** - MCP enables fully on-premises AI integration

## Coming Soon

- **Scheduled Reports** - Automated weekly/monthly AI analysis
- **Proactive Alerts** - AI predicts issues before they occur
- **Custom Models** - Train models on your specific infrastructure patterns
- **Workflow Integrations** - Direct integration with ticketing and chat systems
