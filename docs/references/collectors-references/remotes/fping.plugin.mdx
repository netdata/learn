The fping plugin supports monitoring latency, packet loss and uptime of any number of network end points,
by pinging them with `fping`.

A recent version of `fping` is required (one that supports option `-N`).
The supplied plugin can install it, by running:

```sh
/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/fping.plugin install
```

The above will download, build and install the right version as `/usr/local/bin/fping`.

Then you need to edit `/etc/netdata/fping.conf` (to edit it on your system run
`/etc/netdata/edit-config fping.conf`) like this:

```sh
fping="/usr/local/bin/fping"

hosts="host1 host2 host3"

update_every=1

ping_every=200

fping_opts="-R -b 56 -i 1 -r 0 -t 5000"
```

## alarms

Netdata will automatically attach a few alarms for each host.

## Additional Tips

### Customizing Amount of Pings Per Second

For example, to update the chart every 10 seconds and use 2 pings every 10 seconds, use this:

```sh
update_every=10

ping_every=5000
```

### Multiple fping Plugins With Different Settings

You may need to run multiple fping plugins with different settings for different end points.
For example, you may need to ping a few hosts 10 times per second, and others once per second.

Netdata allows you to add as many `fping` plugins as you like.

Follow this procedure:

**1. Create New fping Configuration File**

```sh
cd /etc/netdata

cp fping.conf fping2.conf
```

Edit `fping2.conf` and set the settings and the hosts you need for the seconds instance.

**2. Soft Link Original fping Plugin to New Plugin File**

```sh
sudo su

cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d

ln -s fping.plugin fping2.plugin
```

That's it. Netdata will detect the new plugin and start it.

You can name the new plugin any name you like.
Just make sure the plugin and the configuration file have the same name.
