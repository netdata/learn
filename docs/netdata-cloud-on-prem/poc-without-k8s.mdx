# Netdata Cloud On-Prem PoC without Kubernetes

These instructions show you how to install a lightweight version of Netdata Cloud when you don't have a Kubernetes cluster. This setup is **for demonstration purposes only** and has no built-in resiliency for any kind of failure.

## What You'll Need

Before you start, ensure you have:

- **Clean Ubuntu installation** (22.04 or 24.04, amd64 architecture)
- **System resources**: 10 CPU cores and 24 GiB of memory
- **Administrator access**: Shell access with sudo privileges
- **TLS certificate**: Valid certificate for your Netdata Cloud On-Prem PoC endpoint (must be trusted by all connecting entities)
- **AWS credentials and license**: AWS ID and License Key (contact us at [info@netdata.cloud](mailto:info@netdata.cloud) if you don't have these)

## Install Your PoC Environment

**Log in to your designated host** and run the installation script:

```bash
curl https://netdata-cloud-netdata-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/provision.sh -o provision.sh
chmod +x provision.sh
sudo ./provision.sh install \
      -key-id "" \
      -access-key "" \
      -onprem-license-key "" \
      -onprem-license-subject "" \
      -onprem-url "" \
      -certificate-path "" \
      -private-key-path ""
```

### What the Script Does

**The installation script will:**

1. **Prompt you for the following information:**

   | Parameter | What You Need to Provide |
   |-----------|--------------------------|
   | `-key-id` | Your AWS ECR access key ID |
   | `-access-key` | Your AWS ECR access key |
   | `-onprem-license-key` | Your Netdata Cloud On-Prem license key |
   | `-onprem-license-subject` | Your Netdata Cloud On-Prem license subject |
   | `-onprem-url` | Your on-premises URL (without http/https protocol) |
   | `-certificate-path` | Path to your PEM encoded certificate |
   | `-private-key-path` | Path to your PEM encoded private key |

2. **Install the required components:**
   - Helm
   - Kubectl  
   - AWS CLI
   - K3s cluster (single node)

3. **Provision your K3s cluster** with the data you provided

**After cluster provisioning completes, your PoC Cloud is ready to use.**

:::warning

**Email Testing Setup**

This script automatically exposes Netdata and also sets up a mailcatcher at `<your-url>/mailcatcher` for testing email functionality.

:::

## Access Your PoC Cloud

**Only email login works** without additional configuration. All emails your PoC Cloud sends will appear in the mailcatcher, which acts as your SMTP server with a simple web interface.

### Login Steps

1. **Open your PoC Cloud** in a web browser using the URL you specified
2. **Enter an email address** when prompted  
3. **Check the mailcatcher** at `<your-url>/mailcatcher` to find your login email
4. **Click the login link** in the email
5. **You're now logged in!** Start adding your first nodes to begin monitoring

## Remove Your PoC

To uninstall the entire PoC environment, use the same script with the `uninstall` option:

```bash
cd <script-directory>
sudo ./provision.sh uninstall
```

:::note

**Automatic Cleanup**

 If your installation fails, the script will automatically prompt you to start the uninstallation process to clean up any partial installation.
