# Netdata Cloud On-Prem Troubleshooting

Your Netdata Cloud On-Prem deployment relies on several infrastructure components that need proper resources and configuration:

**Core Components:**

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Message Brokers**: Pulsar, EMQX
- **Traffic Controllers**: Ingress, Traefik
- **Kubernetes Cluster**

**Monitor and manage these components** according to your organization's established practices and requirements.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Installation Timeout Error

**If your installation fails with this error:**

```
Installing netdata-cloud-onprem (or netdata-cloud-dependency) helm chart...
[...]
Error: client rate limiter Wait returned an error: Context deadline exceeded.
```

**This typically means your cluster doesn't have enough resources.** Here's how to diagnose and fix it:

#### Diagnose the Problem

:::note

**Before you start:**

- **Full installation**: Ensure you're in the correct cluster context
- **Light PoC**: SSH into your Ubuntu VM with `kubectl` pre-configured

:::

:::important

<strong>Always</strong> perform complete uninstallation before trying a new installation. There is a safety check in the installation script that will prevent you from attempting installation twice.

```bash
./provision.sh uninstall
```

<summary><strong>Troubleshooting individual pods in Kuberentes</strong></summary><br/>
<strong>Step 1: Check for stuck pods</strong><br/>

```bash
kubectl get pods -n netdata-cloud
```

:::tip

Look for pods that are not in `Running` state or they are running properly - i.e. `0/1 Running`

:::

<strong>Step 2: Examine resource constraints</strong><br/>
If you found `Pending` pods, check what's blocking them:<br/>

```bash
kubectl describe pod <POD_NAME> -n netdata-cloud
```

<strong>Look at the Events section</strong> for messages about:<br/>

- Insufficient CPU<br/>
- Insufficient Memory<br/>
- Node capacity issues

<strong>Step 3: View your cluster resources</strong><br/>

<strong>Check your overall cluster capacity:</strong><br/><br/>

```bash
# Check resource allocation across nodes
kubectl top nodes

# View detailed node capacity
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 "Allocated resources"
```

</details>

#### Install Custom Dashboard

Custom dashboard helps you get some insights about how the Netdata On-prem installation performs, by exposing some of the crucial metrics
in a dedicated Netdata Cloud Dashboard.

Before you install the custom dashboard, make sure to:

- [monitor the Apache Pulsar](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/collecting-metrics/message-brokers/apache-pulsar)
- [issue the API Token](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud/authentication-&-authorization/api-tokens) with the `scope:all` permissions
- get the Space ID and Room ID where the custom dashboard should be installed

To install custom dashboard go with the following steps:

<strong>Step 1. Download the `netdata-support-dashboard` script</strong><br/>
```bash
wget https://netdata-cloud-netdata-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/netdata-support-dashboard.sh
```

<strong>Step 2. Run the `netdata-support-dashboard`</strong><br/>
```bash
./netdata-support-dashboard.sh --url <netdata-onprem-installation-url> --space <space_id> --room <room_id>
```

#### Fix the Issue

**Compare your available resources** against the [minimum requirements](/docs/netdata-cloud-on-prem/installation#system-requirements). Then **add more resources to your cluster** or **free up existing resources** by removing unnecessary workloads.

#### Submit the support ticket

If you still can't resolve the issue, please submit a support ticket with the support bundle.

To create the support bundle, run:

<strong>Step 1. Download the `netdata-support-tool`</strong><br/>
```bash
wget https://netdata-cloud-netdata-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/netdata-support-tool.sh
```

<strong>Step 2. Run the `netdata-support-tool` to gather support data from your Netdata Cloud On-Prem installation</strong><br/>
```
./netdata-support-tool.sh gather -c <kubectl-context> -n <netdata-cloud-onprem-namespace>
```

<strong>Step 3. Attach the generated bundle to the support ticket</strong><br/>

### Login Problems After Installation

**Your installation might complete successfully, but you can't log in.** This usually happens due to configuration mismatches.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SSO Login Failure**             | Can't authenticate via SSO providers             | Invalid callback URLs, expired SSO tokens, untrusted certificates, incorrect FQDN in `global.public`        | Update SSO configuration in your `values.yaml`, verify certificates are valid and trusted, ensure FQDN matches your certificate |
| **MailCatcher Login (Light PoC)** | Magic links don't arrive, "Invalid token" errors | Incorrect hostname during installation, modified default MailCatcher values                                 | Reinstall with correct FQDN, restore default MailCatcher settings, ensure hostname matches certificate                          |
| **Custom Mail Server Login**      | Magic links don't arrive                         | Incorrect SMTP configuration, network connectivity issues                                                   | Update SMTP settings in your `values.yaml`, verify network allows SMTP traffic, check your mail server logs                     |
| **Invalid Token Error**           | "Something went wrong - invalid token" message   | Mismatched `netdata-cloud-common` secret, database hash mismatch, namespace change without secret migration | Migrate secret before namespace change, perform fresh installation, or contact support for data recovery                        |

:::warning

**Important for Namespace Changes**

If you're changing your installation namespace, the `netdata-cloud-common` secret will be recreated.

**Before you proceed**

Back up your existing `netdata-cloud-common` secret, or wipe your PostgreSQL database to prevent data conflicts.

:::

### Slow or Failing Charts

**When your charts take forever to load or fail with errors**, the problem usually comes from data collection challenges. Your `charts` service needs to gather data from multiple Agents in a Room, requiring successful responses from all queried Agents.

| **Agent Connectivity**    | Queries stall or timeout, inconsistent chart loading                                                | Slow Agents or unreliable network connections prevent timely data collection | Deploy additional [Parent](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/observability-centralization-points/README.md) nodes to provide reliable backends. Your system will automatically prefer these for queries when available |
| **Kubernetes Resources**  | Service throttling, slow data processing, delayed dashboard updates                                 | Resource saturation at your node level or restrictive container limits       | Review and adjust your container resource limits and node capacity as needed                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Database Performance**  | Slow query responses, increased latency across services                                             | PostgreSQL performance bottlenecks in your setup                             | Monitor and optimize your database resource utilization: CPU usage, memory allocation, disk I/O performance                                                                                                                              |
| **Message Broker Issues** | Delayed node status updates (online/offline/stale), slow alert transitions, dashboard update delays | Message accumulation in Pulsar due to processing bottlenecks                 | Review your Pulsar configuration, adjust microservice resource allocation, monitor message processing rates                                                                                                                              |
