# Kubernetes Network Policy Configuration for Netdata Cloud On-Prem

This guide shows you how to configure Kubernetes Network Policies for your Netdata Cloud On-Prem deployment. Network policies **enhance your security** by restricting network traffic between pods in your cluster.

## Enable Network Policies

Network policies are **disabled by default**. To enable them in your deployment, set this Helm value to `true`:

```yaml
global.networkPolicy.enabled: true
```

This applies network policies to **all workloads** managed by your Netdata Cloud On-Prem Helm chart, including Deployments, CronJobs, and provisioning jobs.

## How Default Policies Work

When you enable network policies, the default behavior **restricts communication within your namespace** to only these specified ports:

```yaml
global.networkPolicy.allowIngressTCPPorts: [8080, 8081, 50051]
```

**What each port does:**

- **Port 8080**: Rest API communication
- **Port 8081**: Monitoring traffic
- **Port 50051**: gRPC communication

By default, **only traffic on these ports is permitted** between pods within your Netdata Cloud On-Prem deployment. All other ingress traffic is denied.

### Enable DNS Resolution

You can allow DNS egress traffic for all pods in your namespace by setting:

```yaml
global.networkPolicy.allowEgressDNS: true
```

**This allows your pods to resolve DNS names**, which is essential for most services to function properly.

## Configure External Dependencies

Your Netdata Cloud On-Prem deployment **doesn't manage external dependencies** like Apache Pulsar, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, EMQX, and Redis. To allow communication with these external services, **you must explicitly define network policy rules**.

### Configuration Options

Use these Helm value keys to configure rules for your external services:

| Service           | Configuration Key                                  | Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Traefik**       | `global.networkPolicy.ingressRulesForTraefik`      | Allow ingress traffic through Traefik |
| **PostgreSQL**    | `global.networkPolicy.egressRulesForPostgreSQL`    | Connect to your PostgreSQL database   |
| **EMQX**          | `global.networkPolicy.egressRulesForEMQX`          | Connect to your EMQX message broker   |
| **Elasticsearch** | `global.networkPolicy.egressRulesForElasticsearch` | Connect to your Elasticsearch cluster |
| **Pulsar**        | `global.networkPolicy.egressRulesForPulsar`        | Connect to your Pulsar message system |
| **Redis**         | `global.networkPolicy.egressRulesForRedis`         | Connect to your Redis cache           |

**Each key expects a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy rule definition.** See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) for details on defining NetworkPolicy rules. Your rules should specify the appropriate selectors and port ranges to allow communication with your external dependencies.

### Example Configuration

**PostgreSQL connection example:**

```yaml
global.networkPolicy.egressRulesForPostgreSQL: |-
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
            app: postgresql
```

## Service-Specific Policies

**You can add custom network policies** for individual services using `extraIngress` and `extraEgress` rules. This gives you **fine-grained control** over network access for specific services in your deployment.

## Services That Need Internet Access

Some services in your deployment may need to communicate with external providers on the internet.

### Notification Service

Your `cloud-notifications-dispatcher-service` **may need internet access** to communicate with external notification providers like **Slack** and **Discord**. This is **enabled by default**, but you can customize it:

```yaml
cloud_notifications_dispatcher_service.networkPolicy.allowInternetAccess.enabled: true
cloud_notifications_dispatcher_service.networkPolicy.allowInternetAccess.egressRule:
  |-
  - to:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 443
```

### Account Service

Your `cloud-accounts-service` **may need internet access** to communicate with external identity providers like **Google** or **GitHub**. This is **enabled by default**, but you can customize it:

```yaml
cloud_accounts_service.networkPolicy.allowInternetAccess.enabled: true
cloud_accounts_service.networkPolicy.allowInternetAccess.egressRule: |-
  - to:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 443
```

### Space/Room Service

Your `cloud-spaceroom-service` **may need internet access** to communicate with your custom identity provider. This is **enabled by default**, but you can customize it:

```yaml
cloud_spaceroom_service.networkPolicy.allowInternetAccess.enabled: true
cloud_spaceroom_service.networkPolicy.allowInternetAccess.egressRule: |-
  - to:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
    ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 443
```

:::tip

**Security Best Practice**: For the external dependencies ingress and egress rules, you should precisely define the restrictive rules without giving widely open access.
