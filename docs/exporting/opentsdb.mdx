# Export metrics to OpenTSDB

You can use the OpenTSDB connector for
the [exporting engine](/docs/exporting/exporting-reference) to archive your agent's
metrics to OpenTSDB databases for long-term storage, further analysis, or correlation with data from other sources.

## Configuration

To enable data exporting to an OpenTSDB database, run `./edit-config exporting.conf` in the Netdata configuration
directory and set the following options:

```conf
[opentsdb:my_opentsdb_instance]
    enabled = yes
    destination = localhost:4242
```

Add `:http` or `:https` modifiers to the connector type if you need to use other than a plaintext protocol. For
example: `opentsdb:http:my_opentsdb_instance`,
`opentsdb:https:my_opentsdb_instance`. You can set basic HTTP authentication credentials using

```conf
    username = my_username
    password = my_password
```

The OpenTSDB connector is further configurable using additional settings. See
the [exporting reference doc](/docs/exporting/exporting-reference#options) for details.
