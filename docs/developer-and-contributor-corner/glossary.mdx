- [**Definition Bar**](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/charts): Bar within a composite chart that provides important information and options about the metrics within the chart.

- [**Dimension**](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/charts#dimensions): A dimension is a value that gets shown on a chart.

## E

- [**Flood Protection**](/docs/alerts-&-notifications/notifications/centralized-cloud-notifications/centralized-cloud-notifications-reference#flood-protection): If a node has too many state changes like firing too many alerts or going from reachable to unreachable, Netdata Cloud enables flood protection. As long as a node is in flood protection mode, Netdata Cloud doesnâ€™t send notifications about this node

- [**Functions** or **Netdata Functions**](/docs/top-consumers): Routines exposed by a collector on the Netdata Agent that can bring additional information to support troubleshooting or trigger some action to happen on the node itself.

## G

## I

- [**Internal plugins**](/docs/collecting-metrics): These gather metrics from `/proc`, `/sys`, and other Linux kernel sources. They are written in `C` and run as threads within the Netdata daemon.

## K

- [**Kickstart** or **Kickstart Script**](/docs/netdata-agent/installation/linux): An automatic one-line installation script named 'kickstart.sh' that works on all Linux distributions and macOS.

- [**Kubernetes Dashboard** or **Kubernetes Tab**](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/tabs/kubernetes): Netdata Cloud features enhanced visualizations for the resource utilization of Kubernetes (k8s) clusters, embedded in the default Overview dashboard.

## M

- [**Metrics Collection**](/docs/collecting-metrics): With zero configuration, Netdata auto-detects thousands of data sources upon starting and immediately collects per-second metrics. Netdata can immediately collect metrics from these endpoints thanks to 300+ collectors, which all come pre-installed when you install Netdata.

- [**Metric Correlations**](/docs/netdata-ai/troubleshooting/metric-correlations): A Netdata feature that lets you quickly find metrics and charts related to a particular window of interest that you want to explore further.

- [**Metrics Exporting**](/docs/exporting-metrics): Netdata allows you to export metrics to external time-series databases with the exporting engine. This system uses a number of connectors to initiate connections to more than thirty supported databases, including InfluxDB, Prometheus, Graphite, ElasticSearch, and much more.

- [**Metrics Storage**](/docs/netdata-agent/database#modes): Upon collection the collected metrics need to be either forwarded, exported or just stored for further treatment. The Agent is capable to store metrics both short and long-term, with or without the usage of non-volatile storage.

- [**Metrics Streaming Replication**](/docs/observability-centralization-points/README.md): Each node running Netdata can stream the metrics it collects, in real time, to another node. Metric streaming allows you to replicate metrics data across multiple nodes, or centralize all your metrics data into a single time-series database (TSDB).

## N

## T

- [**Template Entity Type**](/docs/alerts-&-notifications/alert-configuration-reference#entity-types): Entity type that defines rules that apply to all charts of a specific context, and use the template label. Templates help you apply one entity to all disks, all network interfaces, all MySQL databases, and so on.

  even thousands of nodes. There are no actual bottlenecks especially if you retain metrics locally in the Agents.

## V

- [**Visualizations**](/docs/dashboards-and-charts): Netdata uses dimensions, contexts, and families to sort your metric data into graphs, charts, and alerts that maximize your understanding of your infrastructure and your ability to troubleshoot it, along or on a team.
