# BUFFER

`BUFFER` is a convenience library for working with strings in `C`.
Mainly, `BUFFER`s eliminate the need for tracking the string length, thus providing
a safe alternative for string operations.

Also, they are super fast in printing and appending data to the string and its `buffer_strlen()`
is just a lookup (it does not traverse the string).

Netdata uses `BUFFER`s for preparing web responses and buffering data to be sent upstream or
to external databases.
