# Invite your team

Invite new users to your Space by clicking on **Invite Users** in
the [Space](/docs/nightly/getting-started/monitor-your-infrastructure/spaces) management area.

Enter the email addresses for the users you want to invite to your Space. You can enter any number of email addresses,
separated by a comma, to send multiple invitations at once.

Next, choose the War Rooms you want to invite these users to. Once logged in, these users are not restricted only to
these War Rooms. They can be invited to others, or join any that are public.

Click the **Send** button to send an email invitation, which will prompt them
to [sign up](/docs/nightly/getting-started/monitor-your-infrastructure/sign-in-with-email-google-or-github) and join your Space.

Any unaccepted invitations remain under **Invitations awaiting response**. These invitations can be rescinded at any
time by clicking the trash can icon.

## What's next?

If your team members have trouble signing in, direct them to
the [sign in guide](/docs/nightly/getting-started/monitor-your-infrastructure/sign-in-with-email-google-or-github). Once your
team is onboarded to Netdata Cloud, they can view shared assets, such
as [new dashboards](/docs/nightly/visualizations/build-new-dashboards).
