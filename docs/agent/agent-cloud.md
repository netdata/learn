While the Netdata Agent is an enormously powerful _distributed_ health monitoring and performance troubleshooting tool,
many of its users need to monitor dozens or hundreds of systems at the same time. That's why we built Netdata Cloud, a
hosted web interface that gives you real-time visibility into your entire infrastructure.

There are two main ways to use your Agent(s) with Netdata Cloud. You can use both these methods simultaneously, or just
one, based on your needs:

-   Use Netdata Cloud's web interface for monitoring an entire infrastructure, with any number of Agents, in one
    centralized dashboard.
-   Use **Visited nodes** to quickly navigate between the dashboards of nodes you've recently visited.

## Monitor an infrastructure with Netdata Cloud

Netdata Cloud is designed to help you see health and performance metrics, plus active alarms, in a single interface.
Here's what a small infrastructure might look like:

visibility into your entire infrastructure, and why you might consider using it.

reference](/docs/agent/claim) for a complete investigation of Cloud's security and encryption features, plus instructions
for Docker containers.

## Navigate between dashboards with Visited nodes

If you don't want to use Netdata Cloud's web interface, you can still connect multiple nodes through the **Visited
nodes** menu, which appears on the left-hand side of the dashboard.

You can use the Visited nodes menu to quickly navigate between the dashboards of many different Agent-monitored systems.

To add nodes to your Visited nodes menu, you first need to navigate to that node's dashboard, then click the **Sign in**
button at the top of the dashboard. You'll see a screen that says your node is requesting access to your Netdata Cloud
account. Sign in with your preferred method.

When finished, you're redirected back to your node's dashboard, which is now connected to your Netdata Cloud account.
You can now see the Visited nodes menu, which will be populated by a single node.

If you previously went through the Cloud onboarding process to create a Space and War Room, you will also see these
about the Visited Nodes menu. You can click on your Space or any of your War Rooms to navigate to Netdata Cloud and
continue monitoring your infrastructure from there.

To add more Agents to your Visited nodes menu, visit them and sign in again. This process connects that node to your
Cloud account and further populates the menu.

Once you've added more than one node, you can use the menu to switch between various dashboards without remembering IP
addresses or hostnames or saving bookmarks for every node you want to monitor.

## What's next?

The integration between Agent and Cloud is designed to be highly adaptable to the needs of any type of infrastructure or
user. If you want to learn more about how you might want to use or configure Cloud, we recommend the following:

-   Get an overview of Cloud's features by reading [Cloud documentation](/docs/cloud/).
-   Follow the 5-minute [get started with Cloud](/docs/cloud/get-started/) guide to finish
    onboarding and claim your first nodes.
-   Better understand how agents connect securely to the Cloud with [claiming](/docs/agent/claim) and [Agent-Cloud
    link](/docs/agent/aclk) documentation.
