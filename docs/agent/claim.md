Agent claiming allows a Netdata Agent, running on a distributed node, to securely connect to Netdata Cloud. A Space's
administrator creates a **claiming token**, which is used to add an Agent to their Space via the [Agent-Cloud link
(ACLK)](/docs/agent/aclk).

Are you just starting out with Netdata Cloud? See our [get started with
Cloud](/docs/cloud/get-started) guide for a walkthrough of the process and simplified
instructions.

Claiming nodes is a security feature in Netdata Cloud. Through the process of claiming, you demonstrate in a few ways
that you have administrative access to that node and the configuration settings for its Agent. By logging into the node,
you prove you have access, and by using the claiming script or the Netdata command line, you prove you have write access
and administrative privileges.

Only the administrators of a Space in Netdata Cloud can view the claiming token and accompanying script generated by
Netdata Cloud.

> The claiming process ensures no third party can add your node, and then view your node's metrics, in a Cloud account,
> Space, or War Room that you did not authorize.

By claiming a node, you opt-in to sending data from your Agent to Netdata Cloud via the [ACLK](/docs/agent/aclk). This
data is encrypted by TLS while it is in transit. We use the RSA keypair created during claiming to authenticate the
identity of the Agent when it connects to the Cloud. While the data does flow through Netdata Cloud servers on its way
from Agents to the browser, we do not store or log it.

You can claim a node during the Cloud onboarding process, or after you created a Space by clicking on the **USER's
Space** dropdown, then **Manage claimed nodes**.

There are two important notes regarding claiming:

-   _You can only claim any given node in a single Space_. You can, however, add that claimed node to multiple War Rooms
    within that one Space.
-   You must repeat the claiming process on every node you want to add to Netdata Cloud.

## How to claim a node

To claim a node, select which War Rooms you want to add this node to with the dropdown, then copy and paste the script
given by Cloud into your node's terminal. Hit **Enter**.

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if you don't see
the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting). If you prefer not to
use root privileges via `sudo` to run the claiming script, see the next section.

Repeat this process with every node you want to add to Cloud during onboarding. You can also add more nodes once you've
finished onboarding.

### Claim an agent without root privileges

If you don't want to run the claiming script with root privileges, you can discover which user is running the Agent,
switch to that user, and run the claiming script.

Use `grep` to search your `netdata.conf` file, which is typically located at `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf`, for the `run
as user` setting. For example:

```bash
grep "run as user" /etc/netdata/netdata.conf 
    # run as user = netdata
```

The default user is `netdata`. Yours may be different, so pay attention to the output from `grep`. Switch to that user
and run the claiming script.

```bash
netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

Hit **Enter**. The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if
you don't see the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting). 

### Claim an Agent running in Docker

The claiming process works with Agents running inside of Docker containers. You can use `docker exec` to run the
claiming script on containers already running, or append the claiming script to `docker run` to create a new container
and immediately claim it.

#### Running Agent containers

Claim a _running Agent container_ by appending the script offered by Cloud to a `docker exec ...` command, replacing
`netdata` with the name of your running container:

```bash
docker exec -it netdata netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if
you don't see the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting).

#### New/ephemeral Agent containers

Claim a newly-created container with `docker run ...`.

In the example below, the last line calls the [daemon binary](/docs/agent/daemon), sets essential variables, and then
executes claiming using the information after `-W "claim... `. You should copy the relevant token, rooms, and URL from
Cloud.

```bash
docker run -d --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  -v netdatalib:/var/lib/netdata \
  -v netdatacache:/var/cache/netdata \
  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd:ro \
  -v /etc/group:/host/etc/group:ro \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  -v /etc/os-release:/host/etc/os-release:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  netdata/netdata \
  -W set2 cloud global enabled true -W set2 cloud global "cloud base url" "https://app.netdata.cloud" -W "claim \
  -token=TOKEN \
  -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 \
  -url=https://app.netdata.cloud"
```

The container runs in detached mode, so you won't see any output. If the node does not appear in your Space, you can run
the following to find any error output and use that to guide your [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). Replace `netdata`
with the name of your container if different.

```bash
docker logs netdata 2>&1 | grep -E --line-buffered 'ACLK|claim|cloud'
```

### Claim through a proxy

A Space's administrator can claim a node through a SOCKS5 or HTTP(S) proxy.

You should first configure the proxy in the `[cloud]` section of `netdata.conf`. The proxy settings you specify here
will also be used to tunnel the ACLK. The default `proxy` setting is `none`.

```conf
[cloud]
    proxy = none
```

The `proxy` setting can take one of the following values:

-   `none`: Do not use a proxy, even if the system configured otherwise.
-   `env`: Try to read proxy settings from set environment variables `http_proxy`/`socks_proxy`.
-   `socks5[h]://[user:pass@]host:ip`: The ACLK and claiming will use the specified SOCKS5 proxy.
-   `http://[user:pass@]host:ip`: The ACLK and claiming will use the specified HTTP(S) proxy.

For example, a SOCKS5 proxy setting may look like the following:

```conf
[cloud]
    proxy = socks5h://203.0.113.0:1080       # With an IP address
    proxy = socks5h://proxy.example.com:1080 # With a URL
```

You can now move on to claiming. When you claim with the `netdata-claim.sh` script, add the `-proxy=` parameter and
append the same proxy setting you added to `netdata.conf`.

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=MYTOKEN1234567 -rooms=room1,room2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud -proxy=socks5h://203.0.113.0:1080
```

Hit **Enter**. The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if
you don't see the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting).

### Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble claiming a node, this may be because the [ACLK](/docs/agent/aclk) cannot connect to Cloud.

With the Netdata Agent running, visit `http://NODE:19999/api/v1/info` in your browser, replacing `NODE` with the IP
address or hostname of your Agent. The returned JSON contains four keys that will be helpful to diagnose any issues you
might be having with the ACLK or claiming process.

```json
	"cloud-enabled"
	"cloud-available"
	"agent-claimed"
	"aclk-available"
```

Use these keys and the information below to troubleshoot the ACLK.

#### Claiming on older distributions (Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 8, CentOS 6)

If you're running an older Linux distribution or one that has reached EOL, such as Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Debian 8, or CentOS
6, your Agent may not be able to securely connect to Netdata Cloud due to an outdated version of OpenSSL. These old
versions of OpenSSL cannot perform [hostname validation](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Hostname_validation), which
helps securely encrypt SSL connections.

We recommend you reinstall Netdata with a [static build](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart-64), which uses an
up-to-date version of OpenSSL with hostname validation enabled.

If you choose to continue using the outdated version of OpenSSL, your node will still connect to Netdata Cloud, albeit
with hostname verification disabled. Without verification, your Netdata Cloud connection could be vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### cloud-enabled is false

If `cloud-enabled` is `false`, you probably ran the installer with `--disable-cloud` option.

Additionally, check that the `enabled` setting in `var/lib/netdata/cloud.d/cloud.conf` is set to `true`:

```conf
[global]
    enabled = true
```

To fix this issue, reinstall Netdata using your [preferred method](/docs/agent/packaging/installer) and do not add the
`--disable-cloud` option.

#### cloud-available is false

If `cloud-available` is `false` after you verified Cloud is enabled in the previous step, the most likely issue is that
Cloud features failed to build during installation.

If Cloud features fail to build, the installer continues and finishes the process without Cloud functionality as opposed
to failing the installation altogether. We do this to ensure the Agent will always finish installing.

If you can't see an explicit error in the installer's output, you can run the installer with the `--require-cloud`
option. This option causes the installation to fail if Cloud functionality can't be built and enabled, and the
installer's output should give you more error details.

You may see one of the following error messages during installation:

-   Failed to build libmosquitto. The install process will continue, but you will not be able to connect this node to
    Netdata Cloud.
-   Unable to fetch sources for libmosquitto. The install process will continue, but you will not be able to connect
    this node to Netdata Cloud.
-   Failed to build libwebsockets. The install process will continue, but you may not be able to connect this node to
    Netdata Cloud.
-   Unable to fetch sources for libwebsockets. The install process will continue, but you may not be able to connect
    this node to Netdata Cloud.
-   Could not find cmake, which is required to build libwebsockets. The install process will continue, but you may not
    be able to connect this node to Netdata Cloud.
-   Could not find cmake, which is required to build JSON-C. The install process will continue, but Netdata Cloud
    support will be disabled.
-   Failed to build JSON-C. Netdata Cloud support will be disabled.
-   Unable to fetch sources for JSON-C. Netdata Cloud support will be disabled.

One common cause of the installer failing to build Cloud features is not having one of the following dependencies on
your system: `cmake` and OpenSSL, including the `devel` package.

You can also look for error messages in `/var/log/netdata/error.log`. Try one of the following two commands to search
for ACLK-related errors.

```bash
less /var/log/netdata/error.log
grep -i ACLK /var/log/netdata/error.log
```

If the installer's output does not help you enable Cloud features, contact us by [creating an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+needs+triage%2C+ACLK&template=bug_report.md&title=The+installer+failed+to+prepare+the+required+dependencies+for+Netdata+Cloud+functionality)
with details about your system and relevant output from `error.log`.

#### agent-claimed is false

You must [claim your node](#how-to-claim-a-node).

#### aclk-available is false

If `aclk-available` is `false` and all other keys are `true`, your Agent is having trouble connecting to the Cloud
through the ACLK. Please check your system's firewall.

If your Agent needs to use a proxy to access the internet, you must [set up a proxy for
claiming](#claim-through-a-proxy).

If you are certain firewall and proxy settings are not the issue, you should consult the Agent's `error.log` at
`/var/log/netdata/error.log` and contact us by [creating an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+needs+triage%2C+ACLK&template=bug_report.md&title=ACLK-available-is-false)
with details about your system and relevant output from `error.log`.

### Remove and reclaim a node

To remove a node from your Space in Netdata Cloud, delete the `cloud.d/` directory in your Netdata library directory.

```bash
cd /var/lib/netdata   # Replace with your Netdata library directory, if not /var/lib/netdata/
sudo rm -rf cloud.d/
```

This node no longer has access to the credentials it was claimed with and cannot connect to Netdata Cloud via the ACLK.
You will still be able to see this node in your War Rooms in an **unreachable** state.

If you want to reclaim this node into a different Space, you need to create a new identity by adding `-id=$(uuidgen)` to
the claiming script parameters. For example, using the default claiming script:

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud -id=$(uuidgen)
```

The agent _must be restarted_ after this change.

## Claiming reference

In the sections below, you can find reference material for the claiming script, claiming via the Agent's command line
tool, and details about the files found in `cloud.d`.

### The `cloud.conf` file

This section defines how and whether your Agent connects to [Netdata Cloud](/docs/cloud/)
using the [ACLK](/docs/agent/aclk).

| setting        | default                   | info                                                                                                                                   |
|:-------------- |:------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cloud base url | https://app.netdata.cloud | The URL for the Netdata Cloud web application. You should not change this. If you want to disable Cloud, change the `enabled` setting. |
| enabled        | yes                       | The runtime option to disable the [Agent-Cloud link](/docs/agent/aclk) and prevent your Agent from connecting to Netdata Cloud.         |

### Claiming script

A Space's administrator can claim an Agent by directly calling the `netdata-claim.sh` script either with root privileges
using `sudo`, or as the user running the Agent (typically `netdata`), and passing the following arguments:

```sh
-token=TOKEN
    where TOKEN is the Space's claiming token.
-rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2,...
    where ROOMX is the War Room this node should be added to. This list is optional.
-url=URL_BASE
    where URL_BASE is the Netdata Cloud endpoint base URL. By default, this is https://app.netdata.cloud.
-id=AGENT_ID
    where AGENT_ID is the unique identifier of the Agent. This is the Agent's MACHINE_GUID by default.
-hostname=HOSTNAME
    where HOSTNAME is the result of the hostname command by default.
-proxy=PROXY_URL
    where PROXY_URL is the endpoint of a SOCKS5 proxy.
```

For example, the following command claims an Agent and adds it to rooms `room1` and `room2`:

```sh
netdata-claim.sh -token=MYTOKEN1234567 -rooms=room1,room2
```

You should then update the `netdata` service about the result with `netdatacli`:

```sh
netdatacli reload-claiming-state
```

This reloads the Agent claiming state from disk.

### Netdata Agent command line

If a Netdata Agent is running, the Space's administrator can claim a node using the `netdata` service binary with
additional command line parameters:

```sh
-W "claim -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2"
```

For example:

```sh
/usr/sbin/netdata -D -W "claim -token=MYTOKEN1234567 -rooms=room1,room2"
```

If need be, the user can override the Agent's defaults by providing additional arguments like those described
[here](#claiming-script).

### Claiming directory

Netdata stores the Agent's claiming-related state in the Netdata library directory under `cloud.d`. For a default
installation, this directory exists at `/var/lib/netdata/cloud.d`. The directory and its files should be owned by the
user that runs the Agent, which is typically the `netdata` user.

The `cloud.d/token` file should contain the claiming-token and the `cloud.d/rooms` file should contain the list of War
Rooms you added that node to.

The user can also put the Cloud endpoint's full certificate chain in `cloud.d/cloud_fullchain.pem` so that the Agent
can trust the endpoint if necessary.
