title: "Supported collectors list"
description: "Netdata gathers real-time metrics from hundreds of data sources using collectors. Most require zero configuration and are pre-configured out of the box."

---



Netdata uses collectors to help you gather metrics from your favorite applications and services and view them in
real-time, interactive charts. The following list includes collectors for both external services/applications and
internal system metrics.

Learn more about [how collectors work](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work), and then learn how to [enable or
configure](/docs/collect/enable-configure) any of the below collectors using the same process.

Some collectors have both Go and Python versions as we continue our effort to migrate all collectors to Go. In these
cases, _Netdata always prioritizes the Go version_, and we highly recommend you use the Go versions for the best
experience.

If you want to use a Python version of a collector, you need to explicitly [disable the Go
version](/docs/collect/enable-configure), and enable the Python version. Netdata then skips the Go version and
attempts to load the Python version and its accompanying configuration file.

If you don't see the app/service you'd like to monitor in this list:

- Check out our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues). Use the search bar to look for previous
  discussions about that collectorâ€”we may be looking for assistance from users such as yourself!
- If you don't see the collector there, you can make
  a [feature request](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
- If you have basic software development skills, you can add your own plugin
  in [Go](/docs/agent/collectors/go.d.plugin#how-to-develop-a-collector)
  or [Python](/guides/python-collector)

## Netdata collectors

These collectors are recursive in nature, in that they monitor some function of the Netdata Agent itself. Some
collectors are described only in code and associated charts in Netdata dashboards.

- [ACLK (code only)](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/aclk/legacy/aclk_stats.c): View whether a Netdata
  Agent is connected to Netdata Cloud via the [ACLK](/docs/agent/aclk), the volume of queries, process times, and more.
- [Alarms](/docs/agent/collectors/python.d.plugin/alarms): This collector creates an
  **Alarms** menu with one line plot showing the alarm states of a Netdata Agent over time.
- [Anomalies](/docs/agent/collectors/python.d.plugin/anomalies): This collector uses the
  Python PyOD library to perform unsupervised anomaly detection on your Netdata charts and/or dimensions.
- [Exporting (code only)](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/exporting/send_internal_metrics.c): Gather
  metrics on CPU utilization for the [exporting engine](/docs/agent/exporting), and specific metrics for each enabled
  exporting connector.
- [Global statistics (code only)](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/daemon/global_statistics.c): See
  metrics on the CPU utilization, network traffic, volume of web clients, API responses, database engine usage, and
  more.

## Orchestrators

Plugin orchestrators organize and run many of the above collectors.

If you're interested in developing a new collector that you'd like to contribute to Netdata, we highly recommend using
the `go.d.plugin`.

- [go.d.plugin](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin): An orchestrator for data collection modules written in `go`.
- [python.d.plugin](/docs/agent/collectors/python.d.plugin): An orchestrator for data collection modules written in `python` v2/v3.
- [charts.d.plugin](/docs/agent/collectors/charts.d.plugin): An orchestrator for data collection modules written in `bash` v4+.

## Third-party collectors

These collectors are developed and maintained by third parties and, unlike the other collectors, are not installed by
default. To use a third-party collector, visit their GitHub/documentation page and follow their installation procedures.

- [CyberPower UPS](https://github.com/HawtDogFlvrWtr/netdata_cyberpwrups_plugin): Polls CyberPower UPS data using
  PowerPanelÂ® Personal Linux.
- [Logged-in users](https://github.com/veksh/netdata-numsessions): Collect the number of currently logged-on users.
- [nextcloud](https://github.com/arnowelzel/netdata-nextcloud): Monitor Nextcloud servers.
- [nim-netdata-plugin](https://github.com/FedericoCeratto/nim-netdata-plugin): A helper to create native Netdata
  plugins using Nim.
- [Nvidia GPUs](https://github.com/coraxx/netdata_nv_plugin): Monitor Nvidia GPUs.
- [Teamspeak 3](https://github.com/coraxx/netdata_ts3_plugin): Pulls active users and bandwidth from TeamSpeak 3
  servers.
- [SSH](https://github.com/Yaser-Amiri/netdata-ssh-module): Monitor failed authentication requests of an SSH server.

## Etc

- [checks.plugin](/docs/agent/collectors/checks.plugin): A debugging collector, disabled by default.
- [charts.d example](/docs/agent/collectors/charts.d.plugin/example): An example `charts.d` collector.
- [python.d example](/docs/agent/collectors/python.d.plugin/example): An example `python.d` collector.
