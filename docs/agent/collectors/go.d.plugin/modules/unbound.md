[`Unbound`](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver product from NLnet Labs.

This module monitors one or more `Unbound` servers, depending on your configuration.

## Requirements

-   `Unbound` with enabled `remote-control` interface (see [unbound.conf](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf))

If using unix socket:

-   socket should be readable and writeable by `netdata` user

If using ip socket and TLS is disabled:

-   socket should be accessible via network

If TLS is enabled, in addition:

-   `control-key-file` should be readable by `netdata` user
-   `control-cert-file` should be readable by `netdata` user

For auto detection parameters from `unbound.conf`:

-  `unbound.conf` should be readable by `netdata` user
- if you have several configuration files (include feature) all of them should be readable by `netdata` user

## Charts

Module produces following summary charts:

-   Received Queries in `queries`
-   Rate Limited Queries in `queries`
-   DNSCrypt Queries in `queries`
-   Cache Statistics in `events`
-   Cache Statistics Percentage in `percentage`
-   Cache Prefetches in `prefetches`
-   Replies Served From Expired Cache in `replies`
-   Replies That Needed Recursive Processing in `replies`
-   Time Spent On Recursive Processing in `milliseconds`
-   Request List Usage in `queries`
-   Current Request List Usage in `queries`
-   Request List Jostle List Events in `queries`
-   TCP Handler Buffers in `buffers`
-   Uptime `seconds`

If `extended-statistics` is enabled:

-   Queries By Type in `queries`
-   Queries By Class in `queries`
-   Queries By OpCode in `queries`
-   Queries By Flag in `queries`
-   Replies By RCode in `replies`
-   Cache Items Count in `items`
-   Cache Memory in `KB`
-   Module Memory in `KB`
-   TCP and TLS Stream Wait Buffer Memory in `KB`

Per thread charts (only if number of threads > 1):

-   Received Queries in `queries`
-   Rate Limited Queries in `queries`
-   DNSCrypt Queries in `queries`
-   Cache Statistics in `events`
-   Cache Statistics Percentage in `events`
-   Cache Prefetches in `prefetches`
-   Replies Served From Expired Cache in `replies`
-   Replies That Needed Recursive Processing in `replies`
-   Time Spent On Recursive Processing in `milliseconds`
-   Request List Usage in `queries`
-   Current Request List Usage in `queries`
-   Request List Jostle List Events in `queries`
-   TCP Handler Buffers in `buffers`


## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/unbound.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the your agent's [config
directory](agent/step-by-step/step-04.md#find-your-netdataconf-file), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/unbound.conf
```

This Unbound collector only needs the `address` to a server's `remote-control` interface if TLS is disabled or `address` of unix socket.
Otherwise you need to set path to the `control-key-file` and `control-cert-file` files.

The module tries to auto-detect following parameters reading `unbound.conf`:
-   address
-   cumulative
-   use_tls
-   tls_cert
-   tls_key

Module supports both cumulative and non-cumulative modes. Default is non-cumulative. If your server has enabled 
`statistics-cumulative`, but the module fails to auto-detect it (`unbound.conf` is not readable or it is a remote server), 
you need to set it manually in the configuration file. 

Here is an example for several servers:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    address: 127.0.0.1:8953
    use_tls: yes
    tls_skip_verify: yes
    tls_cert: /etc/unbound/unbound_control.pem
    tls_key: /etc/unbound/unbound_control.key

  - name: remote
    address: 203.0.113.10:8953
    use_tls: no

  - name: remote_cumulative
    address: 203.0.113.11:8953
    use_tls: no
    cumulative: yes
      
  - name: socket
    address: /var/run/unbound.sock
```
 
For all available options, please see the module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/unbound.conf).

## Troubleshooting

Ensure that the control protocol is actually configured correctly.
Run following command as `root` user:
> unbound-control stats_noreset

It should print out a bunch of info about the internal statistics of the server.
If this returns an error, you don't have the control protocol set up correctly.

Check the module debug output.
Run following command as `netdata` user:

> ./go.d.plugin -d -m unbound
