[`Docker Engine`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) is the industryâ€™s de facto container runtime that runs on various Linux (CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Oracle Linux, RHEL, SUSE, and Ubuntu) and Windows Server operating systems.

This module will monitor one or more `Docker Engines` applications, depending on your configuration.

## Requirements

-   Docker with enabled [`metric-address`](https://docs.docker.com/config/thirdparty/prometheus/)

## Charts

It produces the following charts:

-   Container Actions in `actions/s`
-   Container States in `containers`
-   Builder Builds Fails By Reason in `fails/s`
-   Health Checks in `events/s`

If Docker is running in in [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) and the instance is a Swarm manager:

-   Swarm Manager Leader in `bool`
-   Swarm Manager Object Store in `count`
-   Swarm Manager Nodes Per State in `count`
-   Swarm Manager Tasks Per State in `count`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/docker_engine.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the your agent's [config
directory](agent/step-by-step/step-04.md#find-your-netdataconf-file), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/docker_engine.conf
```

Needs only `url` to docker `metric-address`. Here is an example for 2 docker instances:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url : http://127.0.0.1:9323/metrics
      
  - name: remote
    url : http://203.0.113.10:9323/metrics
```

For all available options, please see the module's [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/docker_engine.conf).

## Troubleshooting

Check the module debug output. Run the following command as `netdata` user:

> ./go.d.plugin -d -m docker_engine
