[`Kube-proxy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy) is a network proxy that runs on each each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service.

This module will monitor one or more `kube-proxy` instances, depending on your configuration.

## Charts

It produces the following charts:

-   Sync Proxy Rules in `events/s`
-   Sync Proxy Rules Latency in `observes/s`
-   Sync Proxy Rules Latency Percentage in `%`
-   REST Client HTTP Requests By Status Code in `requests/s`
-   REST Client HTTP Requests By Method in `requests/s`
-   HTTP Requests Duration in `microseconds`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/k8s_kubeproxy.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the your agent's [config
directory](/docs/agent/step-by-step/step-04#find-your-netdataconf-file), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/k8s_kubeproxy.conf
```

Needs only `url` to `kube-proxy` metric-address. Here is an example for several instances:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url : http://127.0.0.1:10249/metrics
      
  - name: remote
    url : http://203.0.113.1:10249/metrics
```

For all available options please see module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/k8s_kubeproxy.conf).

## Troubleshooting

Check the module debug output. Run the following command as `netdata` user:

> ./go.d.plugin -d -m k8s_kubeproxy
