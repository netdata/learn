[`MySQL`](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system.

This module will monitor one or more `MySQL` servers, depending on your configuration.

## Requirements

MySQL user specified in configuration should have at least `USAGE, REPLICATION CLIENT` permissions.

To create the user, enter following to MySQL shell:

```sql
CREATE USER 'netdata'@'localhost';
GRANT USAGE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'netdata'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Charts

It will produce following charts:

-   Bandwidth in `kilobits/s`
-   Queries in `queries/s`
-   Queries By Type in `queries/s`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/mysql.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the your agent's [config
directory](agent/step-by-step/step-04.md#find-your-netdataconf-file), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/mysql.conf
```

[DSN syntax in details](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name).

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    dsn: [username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/dbname[?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN]
    # username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value
    # user:password@/dbname
    # Examples:
    # - name: local
    #   dsn: user:pass@unix(/usr/local/var/mysql/mysql.sock)/
    # - name: remote
    #   dsn: user:pass5@localhost/mydb?charset=utf8
```

If no configuration is given, module will attempt to connect to mysql server via unix socket in the following order:

-   `/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock` without password and with username `root`;
-   `/usr/local/var/mysql/mysql.sock` without password and with username `root`;
-   `localhost:3306` without password and with username `root`.


For all available options please see module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/mysql.conf).

## Troubleshooting

Check the module debug output. Run the following command as `netdata` user:

> ./go.d.plugin -d -m mysql
