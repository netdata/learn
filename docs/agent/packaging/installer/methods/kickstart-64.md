This page covers detailed instructions on using and configuring the installation script named `kickstart-static64.sh`.

This method uses a pre-compiled static binary to install Netdata on any Intel/AMD 64bit Linux system and on any Linux
distribution, even those with a broken or unsupported package manager.

To install Netdata from a binary package and get _automatic nightly updates_, run the following as your normal user:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh)
```

> This script installs Netdata at `/opt/netdata`.

> See our [installation guide](/docs/agent/packaging/installer) for details about [automatic
> updates](/docs/agent/packaging/installer#automatic-updates) or [nightly vs. stable
> releases](/docs/agent/packaging/installer#nightly-vs-stable-releases).

## What does `kickstart-static64.sh` do?

The `kickstart.sh` script does the following after being downloaded and run:

-   Detects the Linux distribution and **installs the required system packages** for building Netdata. Unless you added
    the `--dont-wait` option, it will ask for your permission first.
-   Downloads the latest Netdata binary from the [binary-packages](https://github.com/netdata/binary-packages)
    repository. You can also run any of these `.run` files with [makeself](https://github.com/megastep/makeself).
-   Installs Netdata by running `./netdata-installer.sh` from the source tree, including any options you might have
    added.
-   Installs `netdata-updater.sh` to `cron.daily` to enable automatic updates, unless you added the `--no-updates`
    option.
-   Prints a message about whether the insallation succeeded for failed for QA purposes.

If your shell fails to handle the above one-liner, you can download and run the `kickstart-static64.sh` script manually.

```sh
# download the script with curl
curl https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh >/tmp/kickstart-static64.sh

# or, download the script with wget
wget -O /tmp/kickstart-static64.sh https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh

# run the downloaded script (any sh is fine, no need for bash)
sh /tmp/kickstart-static64.sh
```

## Optional parameters to alter your installation

The `kickstart-static64.sh` script passes all its parameters to `netdata-installer.sh`, which you can use to customize
your installation. Here are a few important parameters:

-   `--dont-wait`: Enable automated installs by not prompting for permission to install any required packages.
-   `--dont-start-it`: Prevent the installer from starting Netdata automatically.
-   `--stable-channel`: Automatically update only on the release of new major versions.
-   `--nightly-channel`: Automatically update on every new nightly build.
-   `--disable-telemetry`: Opt-out of [anonymous statistics](/docs/agent/anonymous-statistics) we use to make
    Netdata better.
-   `--no-updates`: Prevent automatic updates of any kind.
-   `--local-files`: Used for [offline installations](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/methods/offline). Pass four file paths:
    the Netdata tarball, the checksum file, the go.d plugin tarball, and the go.d plugin config tarball, to force
    kickstart run the process using those files. This option conflicts with the `--stable-channel` option. If you set
    this _and_ `--stable-channel`, Netdata will use the local files.

## Verify script integrity

To use `md5sum` to verify the intregity of the `kickstart-static64.sh` script you will download using the one-line
command above, run the following:

```bash
[ "ff717737ccc2212a3363dad7fa8bd20d" = "$(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)" ] && echo "OK, VALID" || echo "FAILED, INVALID"
```

If the script is valid, this command will return `OK, VALID`.
