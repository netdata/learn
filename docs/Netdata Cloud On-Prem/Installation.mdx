# Netdata Cloud On-Prem Installation

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have the following ready before starting the installation:

**Required:**

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured
- Helm (version 3.12+ with OCI Configuration)
- Kubectl with access to your Kubernetes cluster
- AWS credentials with ECR access permissions

**System Requirements:**

| Component                  | Details                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kubernetes**             | Version 1.23 or newer, Metrics server installed (for autoscaling), Default storage class configured (SSD-based preferred)               |
| **TLS certificate**        | Single certificate for all endpoints, or separate certificates for frontend, API, and MQTT. Must be trusted by all connecting entities. |
| **Netdata Cloud Services** | 4 CPU cores, 15GiB memory (Cloud services are ephemeral)                                                                                |
| **Third-Party Services**   | 8 CPU cores, 14GiB memory, 160GiB SSD storage for PVCs                                                                                  |

:::note

These requirements were tested with 1,000 directly connected nodes. **Resource needs may vary based on your workload**. The initial sync of directly connected Agents is the most compute-intensive operation.

For example, a Postgres instance with 2 vCPU, 8GiB memory, and 1k IOPS can handle 1,000 nodes in a steady environment when adding nodes in batches of 10–30.

## Required Components

### Third-Party Services

All components below are included in the `netdata-cloud-dependency` package:

| Component              | Version | Purpose                             | Notes                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL**         | 14.15   | Main metadata database              |                                       |

:::warning

**For Production Use**: The provided dependency versions require additional configuration for production environments. Configure these applications according to your production requirements and policies.

:::

## Step by Step Guide to Install

:::warning

**Critical Installation Order**: Dependencies must be installed first, followed by the main Netdata Cloud On-Prem application. Do not skip the dependency installation step.

:::

<strong>Step 1: Configure AWS CLI</strong><br/>

Set up your AWS credentials to access the ECR repository containing the Helm charts.<br/>

_Option 1: Environment Variables_<br/>

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_secret_id>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key>
```

_Option 2: Interactive Setup_<br/>

```bash
aws configure
```

<br/><strong>Step 2: Configure Helm for ECR Access</strong><br/>

Generate a token for ECR access to allow Helm to pull charts from the secured repository:<br/>

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | helm registry login --username AWS --password-stdin 362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

<br/><strong>Step 3: Download Helm Charts</strong><br/>

Pull the required charts to your local machine. The charts will be extracted to your current working directory:<br/>

```bash
helm pull oci://362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/netdata-cloud-dependency --untar  # Optional
helm pull oci://362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/netdata-cloud-onprem --untar
```

:::tip

<strong>Configuration files location:</strong> After extraction, you'll find `values.yaml` files in the respective chart directories that need to be configured for your environment.

:::

<br/><strong>Step 4: Install Dependencies (Required First)</strong><br/>

The `netdata-cloud-dependency` chart _must be installed before_ the main application in `netdata-cloud-onprem`. This chart installs all required third-party applications.<br/>

1. Configure the installation by editing `values.yaml` in your `netdata-cloud-dependency` chart directory<br/>
2. Install the dependencies:<br/>

```bash
cd [your helm chart location]
helm upgrade --wait --install netdata-cloud-dependency -n netdata-cloud --create-namespace -f values.yaml .
```

:::tip

For production environments, we recommend using your own configured versions of these components rather than the provided defaults. `netdata-cloud-dependency` helm chart is designed

:::

<br/><strong>Step 5: Install Netdata Cloud On-Prem</strong><br/>

Install the main application after dependencies are successfully running:<br/>

1. Configure the installation by editing `values.yaml` in your `netdata-cloud-onprem` chart directory<br/>
2. Install the application:<br/>

```bash
cd [your helm chart location]
helm upgrade --wait --install netdata-cloud-onprem -n netdata-cloud --create-namespace -f values.yaml .
```

:::warning

**Critical**: During first installation, a `netdata-cloud-common` secret is created containing critical encryption data. This secret persists through reinstalls and **should never be deleted** as this will result in data loss.

:::

## Verify It Works

After completing the installation steps, verify that everything is running correctly:

<details>
<summary><strong>Check Installation Status</strong></summary><br/>

<strong>Verify Helm installations:</strong><br/>

```bash
helm list -n netdata-cloud
```

<strong>Check pod status:</strong><br/>

```bash
kubectl get pods -n netdata-cloud
```

<strong>Check services:</strong><br/>

```bash
kubectl get svc -n netdata-cloud
```

<strong>All pods should be in Running status</strong> and services should have appropriate endpoints configured.
