# Netdata Cloud On-Prem Image Signature Verification

All your on-premises images stored in the container registry are **digitally signed**, providing a robust way to verify their **authenticity and integrity**. This also applies to **your Helm charts**, because they are distributed as OCI artifacts.

## How Image Signing Works

**AWS ECR** stores all your on-premises images and uses **AWS Signer with Notary v2 support**, a secure image signing and verification standard. Notary v2 offers several verification levels - we **strongly recommend you use strict verification** for maximum security. This level ensures that only images signed by trusted entities and not subsequently revoked are accepted in your environment.

## Two Ways to Verify Your Images

You can verify your image signatures using either method:

| Method                              | Best For                         | How It Works                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Local Verification**              | Manual verification and testing  | You use Notary CLI with AWS Signer plugin on your machine                      |
| **Kubernetes Admission Controller** | Automated cluster-level security | Prevents unauthorized images from being deployed to your cluster automatically |

## Trust and Identity Requirements

Your verification process relies on the **AWS root certificate**, which you can download from the [AWS Signer Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/image-signing-prerequisites.html).

**Your Trusted Identity ARN:** `arn:aws:signer:us-east-1:362923047827:/signing-profiles/onprem`

## Local Verification Step-by-Step

### What You'll Need

Before you start, ensure you have:

- **Notary CLI** installed and configured on your system
- **AWS Signer plugin** installed
- **Your AWS credentials** with ECR access

See the [AWS Signer Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/image-signing-prerequisites.html) for installation details.

### Your Verification Process

<br/><strong>Step 1: Verify Your Plugin Installation</strong><br/>

Check that you have the AWS Signer plugin installed:<br/>

```bash
notation plugin list
```

You should see `com.amazonaws.signer.notation.plugin` in your list.

<br/><strong>Step 2: Configure Your AWS Credentials</strong><br/>

Set your AWS credentials:<br/>

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key>
```

<br/><strong>Step 3: Login to Your ECR</strong><br/>

Authenticate with your ECR registry:<br/>

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | notation login --username AWS --password-stdin 362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

<br/><strong>Step 4: Verify Your Root Certificate</strong><br/>

Ensure you have the AWS root certificate installed:<br/>

```bash
notation cert list
```

The AWS root certificate should appear in your list. If you don't see it, download it from the AWS Signer Developer Guide.

<br/><strong>Step 5: Check Your Policy Configuration</strong><br/>

View your current trust policy:<br/>

```bash
notation policy show
```

Your policy should look like this:<br/>

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "trustPolicies": [
    {
      "name": "test",
      "registryScopes": ["*"],
      "signatureVerification": {
        "level": "strict"
      },
      "trustStores": ["signingAuthority:aws-signer-ts"],
      "trustedIdentities": [
        "arn:aws:signer:us-east-1:362923047827:/signing-profiles/onprem"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<br/><strong>Step 6: Verify Your Image Signature</strong><br/>

Verify a specific image in your registry:<br/>

```bash
notation verify 362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/onprem-cloud-environment-service@sha256:4117f06045b5b94a58ded40238fa7e9c2f228c6e0fac45dc78732052e3f48d1b --plugin-config aws-region=us-east-1
```

<strong>Success means your image is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.</strong>

## Your Kubernetes Admission Controller Setup

For automated verification in your Kubernetes deployments, you can configure the AWS Signer admission controller to **prevent unauthorized images** from being deployed to your cluster automatically.

See the [AWS Signer Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/kubernetes-verification.html) for detailed configuration steps for your environment.

:::tip

**Security Best Practice**: Use strict verification level and regularly verify your images, especially before you deploy updates to your production environments.

## Security Best Practices

:::important

Using signature verification ensures the **integrity and authenticity** of container images, strengthening your overall security posture. It is recommended to use this mechanism in a way that deployment without signature verification is impossible to any environment, including non-production ones.
