# Install on specific environments

This category contains specific instructions for some popular environments. 
If you have a standard environment that is not yet listed here, just use the 
[one line installer kickstart.sh](/docs/installation/installation-methods/one-line-installer-kickstart.sh)

If your environment is somewhat old or unusual, check our 
[platform support policy](/docs/installation/platform-support-policy).
