# Installation methods

Netdata can be installed:

- [As a DEB/RPM package](/docs/installation/installation-methods/native-deb-rpm-packages)
- [As a static binary](/docs/installation/installation-methods/static-binary-packages)
- [From a git checkout](/docs/installation/installation-methods/from-a-git-checkout)
- [As a docker container](/docs/installation/installation-methods/docker)

The [one line installer kickstart.sh](/docs/installation/installation-methods/one-line-installer-kickstart.sh)
picks the most appropriate method out of the first three for any system
and is the recommended installation method, if you don't use containers.

`kickstart.sh` can also be used for 
[offline installation](/docs/installation/installation-methods/offline-systems),
suitable for air-gapped systems.
