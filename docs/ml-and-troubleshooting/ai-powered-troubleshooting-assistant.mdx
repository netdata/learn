# Alert troubleshooting with Netdata Assistant

The Netdata Assistant is a feature that uses large language models and the Netdata community's collective knowledge to guide you during troubleshooting. It is designed to make understanding and root causing alerts simpler and faster.

## Using Netdata Assistant

- Navigate to the alerts tab
- If there are active alerts, the `Actions` column will have an Assistant button
