## Anomaly Rate Based Alerts

It is possible to use the `anomaly-bit` when defining traditional Alerts within netdata. The `anomaly-bit` is just another `options` parameter that can be passed as part of an [alarm line lookup](/docs/agent/health/reference#alarm-line-lookup). 

You can see some example ML based alert configurations below:

- [Anomaly rate based CPU dimensions alarm](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/alerts-and-notifications/configure-alerts#example-8---anomaly-rate-based-cpu-dimensions-alarm)
- [Anomaly rate based CPU chart alarm](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/alerts-and-notifications/configure-alerts#example-9---anomaly-rate-based-cpu-chart-alarm)
- [Anomaly rate based node level alarm](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/alerts-and-notifications/configure-alerts#example-10---anomaly-rate-based-node-level-alarm)
- More examples in the [`/health/health.d/ml.conf`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/ml.conf) file that ships with the agent.
