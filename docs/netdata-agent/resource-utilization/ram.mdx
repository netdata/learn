# RAM Utilization

Using the default [Database Tier configuration](/docs/netdata-agent/database#tiers), Netdata needs about 16KiB per unique metric collected, independently of the data collection frequency.

## Children

Netdata by default should need 100MB to 200MB of RAM, depending on the number of metrics being collected.

This number can be lowered by limiting the number of Database Tiers or switching Database modes. For more information, check [the Database section of our documentation](/docs/netdata-agent/database).

## Parents

| Description                          |         Scope         | RAM Required |                      Notes                       |
|:-------------------------------------|:---------------------:|:------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|
| metrics with retention               | time-series in the db |    1 KiB     |               Metadata and indexes               |
| metrics currently collected          | time-series collected |    20 KiB    | 16 KiB for db + 4 KiB for collection structures  |
| metrics with Machine Learning Models | time-series collected |    5 KiB     |         The trained models per dimension         |
| nodes with retention                 |    nodes in the db    |    10 KiB    |               Metadata and indexes               |
| nodes currently received             |    nodes collected    |   512 KiB    |         Structures and reception buffers         |
| nodes currently sent                 |    nodes collected    |   512 KiB    |         Structures and dispatch buffers          |

These numbers vary depending on metric name length, the average number of dimensions per instance and per context, the number and length of the labels added, the number of database tiers configured, the number of Machine Learning models maintained per metric and similar parameters. For most use cases, they represent the worst case scenario, so you may find out Netdata actually needs less than that.

Each metric currently being collected needs (1 index + 20 collection + 5 ml) = 26 KiB.  When it stops being collected, it needs 1 KiB (index).

Each node currently being collected needs (10 index + 512 reception + 512 dispatch) = 1034 KiB. When it stops being collected, it needs 10 KiB (index).

### Example

A Netdata cluster (two Parents) has one million currently collected metrics from 500 nodes, and 10 million archived metrics from 5000 nodes:

| Description                          |  Entries   | RAM per Entry |    Total RAM |
|:-------------------------------------|:----------:|:-------------:|-------------:|
| metrics with retention               | 11 million |     1 KiB     |    10742 MiB |
| metrics currently collected          | 1 million  |    20 KiB     |    19531 MiB |
| metrics with Machine Learning Models | 1 million  |     5 KiB     |     4883 MiB |
| nodes with retention                 |    5500    |    10 KiB     |       52 MiB |
| nodes currently received             |    500     |    512 KiB    |      256 MiB |
| nodes currently sent                 |    500     |    512 KiB    |      256 MiB |
| **Memory required per node**         |            |               | **35.7 GiB** |

In highly volatile environments (like Kubernetes clusters), Database retention can significantly affect memory usage. Usually, reducing retention on higher Database Tiers helps to reduce memory usage.

## Database Size

Netdata supports memory ballooning to automatically adjust its Database memory size based on the number of time-series concurrently being collected.

The general formula, with the default configuration of Database Tiers, is:

```text
memory = UNIQUE_METRICS x 16KiB + CONFIGURED_CACHES
```

The default `CONFIGURED_CACHES` is 32MiB.

For **one million concurrently collected time-series** (independently of their data collection frequency), **the required memory is 16 GiB**. In detail:

```text
UNIQUE_METRICS = 1000000
CONFIGURED_CACHES = 32MiB

(UNIQUE_METRICS * 16KiB / 1024 in MiB) + CONFIGURED_CACHES =
( 1000000       * 16KiB / 1024 in MiB) + 32 MiB            =
15657 MiB =
about 16 GiB
```

## Parents that also act as `systemd-journal` Logs centralization points

Logs usually require significantly more disk space and I/O bandwidth than metrics. For optimal performance, we recommend to store metrics and logs on separate, independent disks.

Netdata uses direct-I/O for its Database to not pollute the system caches with its own data.

To optimize disk I/O, Netdata maintains its own private caches. The default settings of these caches are automatically adjusted to the minimum required size for acceptable metrics query performance.

`systemd-journal` on the other hand, relies on operating system caches for improving the query performance of logs. When the system lacks free memory, querying logs leads to increased disk I/O.

If you are experiencing slow responses and increased disk reads when metrics queries run, we suggest dedicating some more RAM to Netdata.

We frequently see that the following strategy gives the best results:

1. Start the Netdata Parent, send all the load you expect it to have and let it stabilize for a few hours. Netdata will now use the minimum memory it believes is required for smooth operation.
2. Check the available system memory.
3. Set the page cache in `netdata.conf` to use 1/3 of the available memory.

This will allow Netdata queries to have more caches, while leaving plenty of available memory of logs and the operating system.

In Netdata 2.1 we added the `netdata.conf` option `[db].dbengine use all ram for caches` and `[db].dbengine out of memory protection`.
Combining these two parameters is probably simpler to get best results:

- `[db].dbengine out of memory protection` is by default 10% of total system RAM, but not more than 5GiB. When the amount of free memory is less than this, Netdata automatically starts releasing memory from its caches to avoid getting out of memory. On `systemd-journal` centralization points, set this to the amount of memory to be dedicated for systemd journal.
- `[db].dbengine use all ram for caches` is by default `no`. Set it to `yes` to use all the memory except the memory given above.

With these settings, netdata will use all the memory available but leave the amount specified for systemd journal.
