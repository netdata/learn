# Export metrics to external time-series databases

Netdata allows you to export metrics to external time-series databases with the [exporting
engine](/docs/exporting-data-to-other-systems/exporting-reference). This system uses a number of **connectors** to initiate connections to [more than
thirty](#supported-databases) supported databases, including InfluxDB, Prometheus, Graphite, ElasticSearch, and much
more. 

The exporting engine resamples Netdata's thousands of per-second metrics at a user-configurable interval, and can export
metrics to multiple time-series databases simultaneously.

Based on your needs and resources you allocated to your external time-series database, you can configure the interval
that metrics are exported or export only certain charts with filtering. You can also choose whether metrics are exported
as-collected, a normalized average, or the sum/volume of metrics values over the configured interval.

Exporting is an important part of Netdata's effort to be interoperable
with other monitoring software. You can use an external time-series database for long-term metrics retention, further
analysis, or correlation with other tools, such as application tracing.

## Supported databases

Netdata supports exporting metrics to the following databases through several
[connectors](/docs/exporting-data-to-other-systems/exporting-reference#features). Once you find the connector that works for your database, open its
documentation and the [enabling a connector](/docs/exporting-data-to-other-systems/enable-an-exporting-connector) doc for details on enabling it.
