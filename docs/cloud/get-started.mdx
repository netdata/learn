Ready to get real-time visibility into your entire infrastructure with Netdata Cloud? This guide will walk you through
the onboarding process, such as setting up your Space and War Room and claiming your first nodes.

## Before you start

Before you get started with Cloud, you should have at least one Agent installed. See our [installation
guide](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/) for details.

If you already have an Agent, make sure to update it to v1.22 or higher. Read the [updating
documentation](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/update/) for information on how to update based on the method you used to
install that Agent.

## Begin the onboarding process

Get started by signing in to Netdata Cloud.

Once signed in with your preferred method, you begin onboarding by creating your first Space and War Room, both of which
help you organize your team and the many systems that make up your infrastructure. For example, you can put product and
infrastructure SRE teams in separate Spaces, and then use War Rooms to group Agent-monitored nodes by their service
(`nginx`), purpose (`webservers`), or physical location (`IAD`).

Don't worryâ€”you can always add more Spaces and War Rooms later if you decide to reorganize how you use Netdata Cloud.

## Claim a node

You can claim any node with a running Agent, whether it's a physical or virtual machine, a Docker container, IoT device,
and more.

The claiming process allows a Netdata Agent, running on a distributed node, to securely connect to Netdata Cloud. By
going through the process of claiming a node, you prove you have write and administrative access to that node. Because
no one can claim a node they don't have write and administrative access to, the claiming process ensures you remain in
full control of your nodes and their metrics.

View our [node claiming documentation](/docs/agent/claim/) for details about why we implemented the claiming process and
the encryption methods we use to secure your data in transit. Netdata Cloud does not store or log the metrics or alarm
status of your Agents.

There are two important notes regarding claiming:

-   _You can only claim any given node in a single Space_. You can, however, add that claimed node to multiple War Rooms
    within that one Space.
-   You must repeat the claiming process on every node you want to add to Netdata Cloud.

To claim a node, select which War Rooms you want to add this node to with the dropdown, then copy the script given by
Cloud into your node's terminal. The claiming script takes care of the rest. If you want to claim an agent without using
root privileges, see our [claiming documentation](/docs/agent/claim/#claim-an-agent-without-root-privileges).

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

Hit **Enter**. The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if
you don't see the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting
information](/docs/agent/claim/#troubleshooting). 

Repeat this process with every node you want to add to Cloud during onboarding. You can also add more nodes once you've
finished onboarding.

### Alternatives and other operating systems

**Docker**: You can execute the claiming script to an Agent running as a Docker container, or attach the claiming script
when creating an Agent container for the first time, such as when you're spinning up ephemeral containers. See the
[claim an Agent running in Docker](/docs/agent/claim/#claiming-an-agent-running-in-docker) documentation for details.

**With a proxy**: If your node uses a proxy to connect to the internet, you need to configure the Agent's proxy
settings. See our [claiming through a proxy](/docs/agent/claim/#claiming-through-a-proxy) documentation for details.

## What's next?

You finish onboarding by inviting members of your team to your Space. You can also invite them later. At this point,
you're ready to use Cloud.
