War Rooms organize your connected nodes and provide infrastructure-wide dashboards using real-time metrics and
visualizations.

Once you add nodes to a Space, all of your nodes will be visible in the _All nodes_ war room. This is a special war room
which gives you an overview of all of your nodes in this particular space. Then you can create logical separations of
your nodes into more war rooms. Every War Room has its own dashboards, navigation, indicators, and management tools.

## Navigation

### Switching between views

The default view for any War Room is the [Home tab](/docs/cloud/visualize/overview#home), which give us an overview of
this space, Nodes claimed, data retained in each node and more. The second and most important view is
the [Overview](/docs/cloud/visualize/overview#overview) which uses composite charts to display real-time metrics from
every available node in a given War Room. The [Nodes view](/docs/cloud/visualize/nodes) helps you view key metrics and
alarm status from all your nodes at a glance. Finally, you can use use [Dashboards](/docs/cloud/visualize/dashboards) to
build rich, targeted interfaces for your infrastructure using any number of charts from any number of nodes.

To switch between dashboards, use the tabs beneath the War Room's name. You can also jump to single-node dashboards from
either the [Overview](/docs/cloud/visualize/overview#jump-to-single-node-dashboards) or
the [Nodes view](/docs/cloud/visualize/nodes#jump-to-single-node-dashboards).

### War Room tabs

If you open a [new dashboard](/docs/cloud/visualize/dashboards) or jump to a single-node dashboard, they will open in a
new War Room tab.

Tabs can be rearranged with drag-and-drop or closed with the **X** button. Open tabs persist between sessions, so you
can always come right back to your preferred setup.

### Play, pause, force play, and timeframe selector

A War Room has three different states: playing, paused, and force playing. The default playing state refreshes charts
every second as long as the browser tab is in focus. [Interacting with a chart](/docs/dashboard/interact-charts) pauses
the War Room. Once the tab loses focus, charts pause automatically.

The top navigation bar features a play/pause button to quickly change the state, and a dropdown to select **Force Play**
, which keeps charts refreshing, potentially at the expense of system performance.

Next to the play/pause button is the timeframe selector, which helps you select a precise window of metrics data to
visualize. By default, all visualizations in Netdata Cloud show the last 15 minutes of metrics data.

Use the **Quick Selector** to visualize metrics from predefined timeframes, or use the input field below to enter a
number and an appropriate unit of time. The calendar allows you to select multiple days of metrics data.

Click **Apply** to re-render all visualizations with new metrics data streamed to your browser from each distributed
node. Click **Clear** to remove any changes and apply the default 15-minute timeframe.

The fields beneath the calendar display the beginning and ending timestamps your selected timeframe.

### Indicators

Every War Room features two indicators: **nodes** and **users**.

The nodes indicator displays the number of _active_ (transparent) and _unreachable_ (gray) nodes. Click on either of
them to open a dropdown with their hostnames, status when relevant, and a link to open a single-node dashboard.

The users indicator shows the number of users in the War Room. Clicking on it opens a modal to manage the War Room's
users.

### Node filter

The node filter allows you to quickly filter the nodes visualized in a War Room's views. It appears on the Overview and
Nodes view, but not on single-node dashboards or new dashboards you might have created.

![The node filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/108519236-b0a94700-7286-11eb-8ed1-339ce413d556.png)

Use relational operators (==, !=, contains, and !contains) and logical operators (AND, OR), plus the name, OS, or
services running on your nodes to quickly turn any War Room into a focused troubleshooting interface. See what services
Netdata Cloud can filter by in the [supported collectors list](/docs/agent/collectors/collectors).

For example, `name == centos OR os == debian` filters any nodes by the exact name `centos` or has Debian as its
operating system.

You can also use parentheses around operators to create more sophisticated
filters. `(name contains aws AND os contains ubuntu) OR services == apache` shows only nodes that have `aws` in the
hostname and are Ubuntu-based, or any nodes that have an Apache webserver running on them.

If a filter is invalid or incomplete, Netdata Cloud shows a warning and will not run the filter until it's corrected.

## War Room organization

We recommend a few strategies for organizing your War Rooms.

**Service, purpose, location, etc.**: You can group War Rooms by a service (think Nginx, MySQL, Pulsar, and so on),
their purpose (webserver, database, application), their physical location, whether they're baremetal or a Docker
container, the PaaS/cloud provider it runs on, and much more. This allows you to see entire slices of your
infrastructure by moving from one War Room to another.

**End-to-end apps/services**: If you have a user-facing SaaS product, or an internal service that said product relies
on, you may want to monitor that entire stack in a single War Room. This might include Kubernetes clusters, Docker
containers, proxies, databases, web servers, brokers, and more. End-to-end War Rooms are valuable tools for ensuring the
health and performance of your organization's essential services.

**Incident response**: You can also create new War Rooms as one of the first steps in your incident response process.
For example, you have a user-facing web app that relies on Apache Pulsar for a message queue, and one of your nodes
using the [Pulsar collector](/docs/agent/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/pulsar) begins reporting a suspiciously low
messages rate. You can create a War Room called `$year-$month-$day-pulsar-rate`, add all your Pulsar nodes in addition
to nodes they connect to, and begin diagnosing the root cause in a War Room optimized for getting to resolution as fast
as possible.

## Add War Rooms

If you're the administrator of a Space, add new War Rooms to any Space by clicking on the green plus icon **+** next the
**War Rooms** heading.

![Add a new War Room](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/108433306-01775c00-7203-11eb-931e-46cd81891dd4.png)

In the panel, give the War Room a name and description, and choose whether it's public or private. Anyone in your Space
can join public War Rooms, but can only join private War Rooms with an invitation.

## Manage War Rooms

If you're an administrator of War Room, you can change its settings. Click on the War Room's name in the top navigation
to open a dropdown of options.

![Managing a War Room](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/108433867-efe28400-7203-11eb-995d-1b1e92b956c6.png)

To _change a War Room's name, description, or public/private status_, click on **Manage War Room**.

To _add a connected node_ to a War Room, click on **Add Nodes**. Choose any connected node you want to add to this War
Room by clicking on the checkbox next to its hostname, then click **+ Add** at the top of the panel.

To _view or remove nodes_ in a War Room, click on **List Nodes**. To remove a node from the curernt War Room, click on
the **ðŸ—‘** icon. Removing a node from a War Room does not remove it from your Space.

To _add existing users to a War Room_, click on **Add Users**. See our [invite doc](/docs/cloud/manage/invite-your-team)
for details on inviting new users to your Space in Netdata Cloud.

To _list users in a War Room_, click on **List Users**. You can also add new users with the **+** button.
