Netdata Cloud can send notifications to your team whenever a node triggers an alarm. By enabling notifications, you
ensure no alarm, on any node in your infrastructure, goes unnoticed by you or your team.

Netdata Cloud currently supports email notifications. We're working on additional endpoints and functionality.

If you are a new Netdata Cloud user, alarm notifications are already enabled. If you are an existing Netdata Cloud user,
you need to both enable notifications for your Space, and for your user account. See the
[Space](#manage-alarm-notifications-for-a-space) and [user](#manage-alarm-notifications-per-user) sections below for
details.

> Centralized dispatch of alarm notifications from Netdata Cloud is a independent process from [Agent
notifications](/docs/agent/monitor/enable-notifications). You can enable one or the other, or both, based on your needs.

## Manage alarm notifications for a Space

To enable notifications for a Space, click on the Space's name in the top menu, then **Manage your Space**. In the panel
that appears, click on the **Notifications** tab. This menu option is visible only to administrators.

Click on the toggle to enable or disable a notification method.

### Email

Email alarm notifications show the following information:

-   The Space's name
-   The node's name
-   Alarm status: critical, warning, cleared
-   Previous alarm status
-   Time at which the alarm triggered
-   Chart context that triggered the alarm
-   Name and information about the triggered alarm
-   Alarm value
-   Total number of warning and critical alarms on that node
-   Threshold for triggering the given alarm state
-   Calculation or database lookups that Netdata uses to compute the value
-   Source of the alarm, including which file you can edit to configure this alarm on an individual node

Email notifications also feature a **Go to Node** button, which takes you directly to the offending chart for that node
within Cloud's embedded dashboards.

Here's an example email notification for the `ram_available` chart, which is in a critical state:

### Integrations via webhooks

You can send alarm notification details to any number of integration/automation services like Zapier and Integromat by
setting up new integrations via [webhooks](/docs/cloud/monitor/notifications/webhooks). Once you supply Netdata Cloud
with a webhook URL, it will send a JSON payload with alarm notification details to that service. You can then create
automations or send notifications to other endpoints, based on the capabilities of that service.

For example, you could use Zapier to create a new issue on Jira or send a Slack message, when your nodes trigger alerts
and create alarms.

To add a new integration, you should first set up your integration service with a new webhook-based action. You should
have an incoming webhook URL available.

Next, click the **Add integration** button. In the **URL** field, enter the incoming webhook URL from your integration
service. Click the **Test** button to see whether the service receives the JSON payload from Netdata Cloud.

Read about the JSON payload and see some examples in the [webhooks doc](/docs/cloud/monitor/notifications/webhooks). You
can use this information to customize how your integration service procesesses the incoming alarm information.

## Manage personal alarm notification settings

You, and other individual users in your Space, can also enable and disable notification methods.

Click on your profile icon at the top-right of the Cloud UI, then **Profile** in the dropdown. Click on the
**Notifications** tab in the panel that appears.

notifications](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/99722015-40174200-2a6d-11eb-837e-3de761127ca7.png)

Enable or disable notification methods with the toggle buttons.

Select which the notifications you want to receive from each War Room:

-   **All alarms and unreachable**: Receive notifications for all changes in alarm status: critical, warning, and
    cleared. In addition, receive notifications for any node that enters an unreachable state.
-   **All alarms**: Receive notifications for all changes in alarm status: critical, warning, and cleared.
-   **Critical only**: Receive notifications only for critical alarms.
-   **No notifications**: Receive no notifications for nodes in this War Room.

If a Space's administrator has disabled notifications, you will see a mesage similar to, "E-mail notifications for this space has been disabled by admin," and your settings have no effect.

## Flood protection

If a node has too many state changes like firing too many alarms or going from reachable to unreachable, Netdata Cloud
enables flood protection. As long as a node is in flood protection mode, Netdata Cloud does not send notifications about
this node. Even with flood protection active, it is possible to access the node directly, either via Netdata Cloud or
the local Agent dashboard at `http://NODE:19999`.

## What's next?

Netdata Cloud's alarm notifications feature leverages the alarms configuration on each node in your infrastructure. If
you'd like to tweak any of these alarms, or even add new ones based on your needs, read our [health
quickstart](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms).

You can also [view active alarms](/docs/cloud/monitor/alarms) in Netdata Cloud for an instant visualization of the
health of your infrastructure.
