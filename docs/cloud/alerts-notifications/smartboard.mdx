The Alerts view gives you a high level of availability and performance information for every node you're
monitoring with Netdata Cloud. We expect it to become the "home base" for many Netdata Cloud users who want to instantly
understand what's going on with their infrastructure and exactly where issues might be.

The Alerts view is available entirely for free to all users and for any number of nodes.

## Alerts table and filtering

The alerts table shows all active alerts in your War Room, including the alert's name, the most recent value, a
timestamp of when it became active, and the relevant node.

You can use the checkboxes in the filter pane on the right side of the screen to filter the alerts displayed in the table
by Status, Class, Type & Componenet, Role, Operating System, or Node.

Click on any of the alert names to see the alert.

## View active alerts

In the `Active` subtab, you can see exactly how many **critical** and **warning** alerts are active across your nodes. 

## View configured alerts 

You can view all the configured alerts on all the agents that belong to a War Room in the `Alert Configurations` subtab. 
From within the Alerts view, you can click the `Alert Configurations` subtab to see a high level view of the states of 
the alerts on the nodes within this War Room and drill down to the node level where each alert is configured with their latest status.

## Nodes map

The nodes map puts each node into a separate box and displays the number of critical and warning alerts.

Hover over any box on the map to reveal a popup with the node's name and the name, value, and timestamp for each active
alert. Click on any box to filter the [alerts table](#alerts-table) for that node only.

Click on any of the alert names to see the alert [in
context](/docs/cloud/alerts-notifications/view-active-alerts#view-alerts-in-context-with-alerts) with the chart and
dimension that triggered it.

The nodes map can also can also be filtered by severity and operating system type.
