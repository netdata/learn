# slabinfo.plugin

SLAB is a cache mechanism used by the Kernel to avoid fragmentation.

Each internal structure (process, file descriptor, inode...) is stored within a SLAB.

## configuring Netdata for slabinfo

The plugin is disabled by default because it collects and displays a huge amount of metrics.
To enable it set `slabinfo = yes` in the `plugins` section of the `netdata.conf` configuration file.

If you are using [our official native DEB/RPM packages](/docs/installing/native-linux-distribution-packages), you will additionally need to install the `netdata-plugin-slabinfo`
package using your system package manager.

There is currently no configuration needed for the plugin itself.

As `/proc/slabinfo` is only readable by root, this plugin is setuid root.

## For what use

This slabinfo details allows to have clues on actions done on your system.
In the following screenshot, you can clearly see a `find` done on a ext4 filesystem (the number of `ext4_inode_cache` & `dentry` are rising fast), and a few seconds later, an admin issued a `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_cached` as their count dropped.
