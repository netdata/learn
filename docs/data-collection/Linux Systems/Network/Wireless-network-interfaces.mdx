## Overview

Monitor wireless devices with metrics about status, link quality, signal level, noise level and more.



This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per wireless device



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| wireless.status | status | status |
| wireless.link_quality | link_quality | value |
| wireless.signal_level | signal_level | dBm |
| wireless.noise_level | noise_level | dBm |
| wireless.discarded_packets | nwid, crypt, frag, retry, misc | packets/s |
| wireless.missed_beacons | missed_beacons | frames/s |
