# Monitor anything with Netdata

Netdata uses collectors to help you gather metrics from your favorite applications and services and view them in
real-time, interactive charts. The following list includes collectors for both external services/applications and
internal system metrics.

Learn more
about [how collectors work](/docs/data-collection), and
then learn how to [enable or
configure](/docs/data-collection/collectors-configuration#enable-and-disable-a-specific-collection-module) any of the below collectors using the same process.

Some collectors have both Go and Python versions as we continue our effort to migrate all collectors to Go. In these
cases, _Netdata always prioritizes the Go version_, and we highly recommend you use the Go versions for the best
experience.

If you want to use a Python version of a collector, you need to
explicitly [disable the Go version](/docs/data-collection/collectors-configuration#enable-and-disable-a-specific-collection-module),
and enable the Python version. Netdata then skips the Go version and attempts to load the Python version and its
accompanying configuration file.

## Add your application to Netdata

If you don't see the app/service you'd like to monitor in this list:

- If your application has a Prometheus endpoint, Netdata can monitor it! Look at our
  [generic Prometheus collector](/docs/data-collection/monitor-anything/any-application---generic-collectors/prometheus-endpoints).

- If your application is instrumented to expose [StatsD](https://blog.netdata.cloud/introduction-to-statsd/) metrics,
  see our [generic StatsD collector](/docs/data-collection/monitor-anything/any-application---generic-collectors/statsd).

- If you have data in CSV, JSON, XML or other popular formats, you may be able to use our
  [generic structured data (Pandas) collector](/docs/data-collection/monitor-anything/any-application---generic-collectors/structured-data-pandas),

- Check out our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues). Use the search bar to look for previous
  discussions about that collector—we may be looking for assistance from users such as yourself!

- If you don't see the collector there, you can make
  a [feature request](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

- If you have basic software development skills, you can add your own plugin
  in [Go](/docs/improving-netdata---developers/external-plugins/go.d.plugin#how-to-develop-a-collector)
  or [Python](/docs/improving-netdata---developers/external-plugins/python.d.plugin/develop-a-custom-data-collector-in-python)

## Service and application collectors

configure any of these collectors according to your setup and infrastructure.

## Netdata collectors

These collectors are recursive in nature, in that they monitor some function of the Netdata Agent itself. Some
collectors are described only in code and associated charts in Netdata dashboards.

- [ACLK (code only)](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/aclk/legacy/aclk_stats.c): View whether a Netdata
  Agent is connected to Netdata Cloud via the [ACLK](/docs/deployment-in-production/secure-your-nodes/agent-cloud-link-aclk), the
  volume of queries, process times, and more.
- [Alarms](/docs/data-collection/monitor-anything/netdata/alarms): This collector
  creates an
  **Alarms** menu with one line plot showing the alarm states of a Netdata Agent over time.
- [Anomalies](/docs/data-collection/monitor-anything/any-application---generic-collectors/anomalies): This
  collector uses the
  Python PyOD library to perform unsupervised anomaly detection on your Netdata charts and/or dimensions.
- [Exporting (code only)](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/exporting/send_internal_metrics.c): Gather
  metrics on CPU utilization for
  the [exporting engine](/docs/exporting-data/exporting-reference), and specific metrics for
  each enabled
  exporting connector.
- [Global statistics (code only)](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/daemon/global_statistics.c): See
  metrics on the CPU utilization, network traffic, volume of web clients, API responses, database engine usage, and
  more.

## Orchestrators

Plugin orchestrators organize and run many of the above collectors.

If you're interested in developing a new collector that you'd like to contribute to Netdata, we highly recommend using
the `go.d.plugin`.

- [go.d.plugin](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin): An orchestrator for data collection modules written in `go`.
- [python.d.plugin](/docs/improving-netdata---developers/external-plugins/python.d.plugin): An
  orchestrator for data collection modules written in `python` v2/v3.
- [charts.d.plugin](/docs/improving-netdata---developers/external-plugins/charts.d.plugin): An
  orchestrator for data collection modules written in `bash` v4+.

## Third-party collectors

These collectors are developed and maintained by third parties and, unlike the other collectors, are not installed by
default. To use a third-party collector, visit their GitHub/documentation page and follow their installation procedures.

<details>
<summary>Typical third party Python collector installation instructions</summary>

In general the below steps should be sufficient to use a third party collector.

1. Download collector code file
   into [folder expected by Netdata](/docs/improving-netdata---developers/external-plugins#environment-variables).
2. Download default collector configuration file
   into [folder expected by Netdata](/docs/improving-netdata---developers/external-plugins#environment-variables).
3. [Edit configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/collect/enable-configure#configure-a-collector)
   from step 2 if required.
4. [Enable collector](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/collect/enable-configure#enable-a-collector-or-its-orchestrator).
5. [Restart Netdata](/docs/getting-started/manage-and-configure/start-stop-or-restart-the-netdata-agent)

For example below are the steps to enable
the [Python ClickHouse collector](https://github.com/netdata/community/tree/main/collectors/python.d.plugin/clickhouse).

```bash
# download python collector script to /usr/libexec/netdata/python.d/
$ sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/community/main/collectors/python.d.plugin/clickhouse/clickhouse.chart.py -O /usr/libexec/netdata/python.d/clickhouse.chart.py

# (optional) download default .conf to /etc/netdata/python.d/
$ sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/community/main/collectors/python.d.plugin/clickhouse/clickhouse.conf -O /etc/netdata/python.d/clickhouse.conf

# enable collector by adding line a new line with "clickhouse: yes" to /etc/netdata/python.d.conf file
# this will append to the file if it already exists or create it if not
$ sudo echo "clickhouse: yes" >> /etc/netdata/python.d.conf

# (optional) edit clickhouse.conf if needed
$ sudo vi /etc/netdata/python.d/clickhouse.conf

# restart netdata 
# see docs for more information: https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/start-stop-restart.md
$ sudo systemctl restart netdata
```
