# Export metrics to JSON document databases

You can use the JSON connector for the [exporting engine](/docs/nightly/exporting-data/exporting-reference) to archive your agent's metrics to JSON
document databases for long-term storage, further analysis, or correlation with data from other sources.

## Configuration

To enable data exporting to a JSON document database, run `./edit-config exporting.conf` in the Netdata configuration
directory and set the following options:

```conf
[json:my_json_instance]
    enabled = yes
    destination = localhost:5448
```

Add `:http` or `:https` modifiers to the connector type if you need to use other than a plaintext protocol. For example: `json:http:my_json_instance`,
`json:https:my_json_instance`. You can set basic HTTP authentication credentials using

```conf
    username = my_username
    password = my_password
```

The JSON connector is further configurable using additional settings. See 
the [exporting reference doc](/docs/nightly/exporting-data/exporting-reference#options) for details.
